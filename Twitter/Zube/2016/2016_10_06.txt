        Pence keeps mentioning a War on Coal. The Earth laughs and creates another hurricane. #VPDebate
        This "debate" is more and more like some crazy comment thread. #VPDebate
        The Dems are incredibly weak on economic issues, but luckily for them they face *this.* #VPDebate
        Both parties want to privatize Social Security. And the idea that the Clintons are heirs to the New Deal . . . puke. #VPDebate
        The Dems are officially the New Republicans. Little wonder that what's left of the old GOP flails to find a handle. #VPDebate
        KAINE: I love guns!
        PENCE: Here's a guy I never met who died horribly.
        KAINE: Trump treats women horribly.
        Kaine doesn't mention that Obama has deported people at record levels. But Trump, who only talks about it, is worse. #VPDebate
        KAINE: How are we going to battle terrorism? Expand the war in the Middle East. Duh. #VPDebate
        KAINE: Hillary will wear the heads of her victims on a belt designed by a woman who Trump called a pig. #VPDebate
        NATO *is* obsolete. What is its point other than imperial expansion? #VPDebate
        Pence: "rebuild our military"? Is the Pentagon short a few billion? #VPDebate
        KAINE: We're the war party, people! War! WAR! #VPDebate
        Kaine favorably quoting Reagan on nukes. Who knew that Reagan was a liberal? #VPDebate
        The rest of the planet are busy building bomb shelters. #VPDebate
        Liberals on Twitter are cheering Kaine's war mongering. A sorry preview of the next four years. #VPDebate
        KAINE: Putin is a dictator.
        "What about a North Korean nuclear attack on us?" No one flinches. This country is insane, and most of the population accepts it. #VPDebate
        OK. I'm done. These two assholes are all yours. #VPDebate

        Might not be quite as terrifying as Trump having the nuclear codes, but remember: he'd also have drones. More versatile & used all the time.

        1950s-level fearmongering bullshit @SenFeinstein op-ed. But real propaganda? Zero discussion of costs of prohibitionhttp://bit.ly/2dZJHTr 
        Things not asked yet: Income inequality, jobs, money in politics, climate change. We've spent nearly half the debate on Russia! #VPDebate
        I feel a little insulted that Pence's discrimination against #LGBT people isn't deemed important enough to discuss. #VPDebate

        New Yorker on CNN on who pundits say won a debate. Everyone just delete your accounts. This is a flying garbage fire jumping a rabid shark.https://twitter.com/PGourevitch/status/783499075958272000 ... 
        How many people from the New Yorker, CNN, NYTimes, MSNBC, FoxNews & WashPost are literally paid to shit out opinions on who won a debate?
        Clearly, the candidate who won the debate actually lost by winning, because they were expected to lose and so by winning, it means they lost
        The debate's winner: people paid to opine on who won, and are paid with the limited resources that could instead fund real journalism.
        I know everyone is debating the debate over who won the debate. But I wanted to remind you that this came out todayhttp://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/donald-trump-vp-mike-pence-pledged-limit-gaming-then-helped-casinos-after-campaign ...

        Yahoo had some absolutely first rate security talent on its "paranoids" team. This whole debacle is a sad reflection of how far Yahoo fell.
        The fact that the security team discovered the backdoor reflects their talent; that they weren't told reflects calcified disfunction.
        Strong correlation between commenting on a certain political candidate and being reminded by strangers that I'm a dumbass.
        See also: the "when you get a novel technical-assistance demand, tell your damn CSO" part of our Black Hat slides. https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Granick-When-The-Cops-Come-A-Knocking-Handling-Technical-Assistance-Demands-From-Law-Enforcement.pdf ... https://twitter.com/granick/status/783380452912402432 ... 
        "Cancel your Yahoo account" may be an appropriate response, but it's not going to fix this.
        I've never been forced to walk the tightrope that Yahoo security folks found themselves on. Grateful some made it across.
        Y! may be doomed but i'm still proud of my ex-coworkers on the security team for finding the backdoor quickly and eventually whistleblowing
        Note: Despite a similar name, I am not affiliated with the hurricane currently over the Caribbean, and do not endorse its path.
        One of my servers crashed and I don't have time to watch the VP debate. Wish I had thought of this for the presidential debate.
        Everything I'm seeing on twitter about this debate makes me grateful I'm trying to rebuild this server.
        You know, Pence's argument once put me and my family into an Internment camp on the grounds they "couldn't be certain" of our loyalty #Shame
        Carefully worded non-denial-denial from Yahoo raises new questions, answers none.https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/783625945261277184 ... 
        Insufficient details to conclude much about legalities of the Yahoo story. But keeping the security team in the dark was technically insane.
        It tells us that, from the top of the company, the security group wasn't meaningfully empowered. Probably contributed to 2014 breach, too.
        This matters not just for what it tells us about surveillance, but what it tells us about trusting cloud providers to secure data generally.

        How to save the princess in 8 programming languages
        so, I identified a problem I have been having with my recently upgraded Nexus 6p phones.  unsure how to solve it yet... 1/?
        Before I upgraded to Android n, I would use this phone as a mobile hotspot w/o issue.  Decent enough that I could stream Sunday ticket 2/?
        After the n upgrade, can't stream crap.  General network is slow.  Stuff on the phone is decent, but over the hotspot sux 3/?
        So I ping my phone from my tablet and the ping times over wifi vary from between sub 10ms to 400ms. Wtf?  4/?
        So, today I inadvertantly stumbled onto something.  If the phone screen is off, the ping time is in the hundreds of ms.  5/?
        However, if the phone screen is on, the ping times are <10ms.  So apparently the sleep mode fscks with the wifi...  Ugh 6/?
        There isn't an obvious way to fix this behavior other than screwing with the sleep timeout which seems suboptimal.... Grrrr 7/7

        The #VPDebate should demonstrate what Trump/Pence policies will actually look like, which means probably to the right of Rick Santorum.
        If democracy only works when many people vote and Republicans are fearful of high turnout, we should see a lesson there. #VPDebate
        Tim Kaine should be the star of a really heartfelt Richard Linklater film. Mike Pence belongs in a straight-to-DVD Seagal movie. #VPDebate

        It's true, Russia probably isn't going to invade the Crimea again.
        Kaine could have just said "Vladimir Putin" but instead he talked so much I forgot what he was trying to say. I hate him.
        Kaine: You are literally running to be Donald Trump's vice president.

        Kaine strategy--lose debate but quote Trump a lot; Pence strategy--win debate but don't defend Trump
        Well, he did just get Pence to admit he and Trump don't trust women.
