        @mattblaze yes. During Turkey's Gezi Park protests, I threatened to willfully provoke the police. They only stopped smoking during tear gas.

        This is an interesting essay about American racial dynamics and how they intersect with the rise of China.http://newbloommag.net/2016/08/04/great-wall-whitewashing-controversy/ ... 
        What is fascinating about the controversy over #TheGreatWall is what is left unsaid. Here's a critique of the film.https://twitter.com/ConstanceWu/status/759086955816554496 ... 
        The white savior myth is deeply rooted and racist. What is new is how much control Chinese censors have over Hollywood.
        No one in Hollywood who wants a career would dare offend the Chinese government. This is true of actors, execs, writers, etc.
        This U.S. gov't report, "Directed by Hollywood, Edited by China" lays it out. http://www.uscc.gov/Research/directed-hollywood-edited-china-how-china%E2%80%99s-censorship-and-influence-affect-films-worldwide ... 
        That report was almost totally ignored b/c all our major media companies also want to market films/content in China.
        This is one of the most serious problems with media consolidation. It opens the door to foreign control of our media.
        What is interesting is the debate over #TheGreatWall *completely* avoids the control that the Chinese gov't exerts in Hollywood.
        It does not excuse the white savior myth and casting decisions. But it suggests those decisions are made for political reasons in China.
        This is *not* your standard Hollywood execs being racist controversy. Well it's that. But it's also something very new.
        It has been 80 years at least since anyone had to contend with a rival commercial and military power. Assumption is US always on top.
        Thus, all decisions made are a result of US exertions of power. The notion that decisions about America *aren't* made in America is new.
        Point being that we no longer have control over our cultural and media industry b/c our competition policy has allowed that.
        Want to be brave? Calling out racism in Hollywood is brave. But calling out Chinese control of Hollywood risks career suicide.
        I can't believe Stephen Colbert was able to run this segment.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WBsahU3X4 ... 
        As of this year a "Chinese-owned company the largest movie-theater operator in the U.S."http://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-entertainment-buy-carmike-cinemas-1457050915 ... 
        This is a free speech and sovereignty issue. There are government censors now. They just don't work for our government.
        The best way to block this? Keep stuff small. Smaller theater chains, smaller studios, smaller distributors.
        That would create more diversity of production and distribution. More creativity, innovation, efficiency.
        Not only would this erode China's ability to censor our media but it would erode the dominance of Marvel/StarWars/StarTrek comic monopolies.

        Dear @defcon, I'm disappointed:https://twitter.com/dhelder/status/761777348458913796 ... 
        Saw a group of @defcon attendees loudly harassing a group of Muslim women. So disappointing.
