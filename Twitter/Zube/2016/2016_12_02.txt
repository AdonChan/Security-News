        One time I was going to write a blog post about the epistemological ideas behind hiding knowledge in data indistinguishable from noise.
        In strong encryption schemes, the data is stored in such a way that it looks to an outside observer as to have no structure or pattern.
        If you encrypt data with a key that would take more than all the energy in the universe to crack, and you lose the key, does the data exist?
        After all, even you cannot determine if the data you stored is now anything but electromagnetic noise from the birth of the universe.
        Your answer has implications. If your wedding photos from a soul mate who passed away are encrypted with a lost key, do you still have them?
        Years ago, I lost something precious to me. Something that can never be replaced. Locked away in a file I no longer have the key for.
        I still battle to this day what that means. Emotionally.
        @SwiftOnSecurity You have consigned something precious to the structure of the universe itself. It was, it is, it ever shall be.

        "petrified in confirmation bias"
        It is a problem, we do need "proving grounds" for teens and young adults to learn social interaction models, but everything is converging...
        Grew up on alt and moved to progressively less obscure games forums, then slashdot, then tech forums, etc. I had a ramp to prove-out stuff.
        Don't like throwing kids in the deep end where everything they say since they're 11 is tied to their actual name, and put up against adults.
        Heck, I'm an adult who tries to avoid stuff that looks bad out of context, and I still get blasted. Kids have absolutely no chance at this.
        Learning to live with that pain, and understanding that engaging to dispute lies and misrepresentations isn't always the right move... sigh.

        Too many ideas:
        Can you design a usable CPU simple enough that you will never need a microcode update? There is a reason for this madness.
        Is the answer to start with @risc_v ? Is it already too complex?
        Should we recover the AMD2900 bit-slice processor design and simply shrink it?
        It is pretty obvious that we cannot continue with these untestable (and untested) CPUs.
        @cynicalsecurity @risc_v All of which points to simplicity as a key design requirement
        @cynicalsecurity @risc_v SARATOGA core from my dissertation is ~9k lines of Verilog, 2-way in-order + hardware threading (barrel scheduler)
        @cynicalsecurity @risc_v That was a MIPS but I think RISCV is a nice arch to build around too. And this is the UPPER end of complexity IMO

        If you hold exports constant and increase imports, the trade deficit goes up, but GDP doesn't fall.

        I'm not sure I understand the point of criticizing people talking to to Trump about cabinet positions as "making a deal with the devil".
        It seems like it's in everyone's interest for Trump to fill the remaining slots with as competent people as possible.
        It's not like the Trump administration will be competing with some other US president who we can root for to be more successful.
        I guess you could hope that the administration becomes such a fiasco that we end up being annexed by Canada, but that seems a long shot.
        (Psst, Canada, we'll leave the back gate unlocked. You'll be cheered as liberators, I promise.).

        Here's the Steelworkers statement on the Carrier deal.http://www.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2016/usw-supports-carrier-corp-continuing-domestic-production ... 
        Unclear what this deal is, but crony capitalism and bargaining with large employers are not the same thing.https://twitter.com/cabaum1/status/804133567164989442 ... 
        A lot of political leaders deal with large employers and use carrots and sticks, and large employers do that as well w/politicians.
        Kevin Drum calls conditioning gov't contracts on keeping jobs in the US a "massive abuse of power". http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/donald-trump-working-class-indiana ... 
        That is straight up robber baron era thinking. Since WWI we've ALWAYS conditioned our defense industrial base on social priorities.
        HT @matthewstoller: Criticizing Trump's Carrier stunt, Mother Jones calls placing conditions on government contracts abuse of power. Wha?
        @matthewstoller @johnennis And they've always resorted to that claim, ever since Rbt Morris called legal tender laws confiscatory.

        The 'automation will kill these jobs anyway' narrative is so dishonest. Why are they moving the jobs to Mexico?https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/804172472723656705 ... 
        Carrier was moving the jobs to Mexico. They were not automating them. Who is lying here?https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/804173383642517504 ... 
        There was automation in the 1950s, too. 1850s as well, actually. This is a political question. Workers know this.https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/804173793103085568 ... 
        Automation does not explain massive stock buybacks, CEO pay, the looting of these corporations, tax incentives to offshore.
        @matthewstoller Thank you! If it's automation, what's the little kid doing working in that sweatshop? Is he a robot?

        Attackers can learn almost everything about your network from just phishing a member of technical support staff.
        Sometimes to enhance security and reduce attack surface of a system the answer is not to add more technology, but to take away technology.
        Every new line of code, every new device- if you have an assumed breached network and a high value asset, modernization may be the inroad.
        If your network has had 'guests' for an extended period, they are likely including themselves in your upgrade cycles.
        Try to include attackers that may know every detail of your network,all of your shortcomings,and all of your secrets in your threat models.
        What about the co secrets you protect by using a vpn & other means of encryption that could be misconstrued as "intent"

        When I was a kid, the goal was to be smart. Not to get a lot done, because you can't easily test that.
        As a parent I should focus on what's hard for schools to teach: imagination, initiative, independence.
        I have the better deal. Teaching imagination is a lot more fun than teaching times tables.
        Of course imagination can be taught. (You find the kind of imagination they already have, and encourage more of it.)
