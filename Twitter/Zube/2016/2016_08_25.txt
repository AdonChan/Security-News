        The problem behind "Sweet32" is NOT TRIPLE DES. It's 8-byte-block ciphers. BLOWFISH IS ONE OF THOSE.
        @tqbf @matthew_d_green What about CBC? Or is it possible to mount the same attack on CTR (with sane counters and IVs)?
        @aris_ada @tqbf If you use random initial counters and don't rekey fast enough. Yes.
        @tqbf It's 8-byte block ciphers used in a scenario that most closely comports with TLS, where 3DES is commonly supported.
        @tqbf I'm sure there are crazy stupid things you can do that support blockwise KPA attacks on Blowfish, but TLS-3DES is the poster child.

        Ironically, I have much more confidence in the integrity of elections run by people who don't say stuff like this.https://twitter.com/nudehaberdasher/status/768199318134218752 ... 
        But what do I know?
        For exmpls of insecure e-voting systems (+ more importantly, broken processes that certify them), see our 2008 paper https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/evt08/tech/full_papers/aviv/aviv.pdf ... 
        What's changed since then? The specific bugs may be different today.
        @mattblaze The other thing that's changed is the threat model: we now KNOW that foreign government hackers are taking an interest.
        1. Our e-voting systems are definitely insecure and can be attacked.
        This makes progress in any debate about e-voting difficult, often occurring across purposes.
        In particular, the loudest political voices tend to be the losers in some election.
        We tend to have this discussion a few months before general elections, when it's too late to make substantive changes to voting tech.
        So basically, public concern about e-voting integrity peaks at roughly the point when the choice is use existing tech or postpone election.
