        Trump is an easy and obvious target (going back to Spy magazine days). A  well-worn punching bag. We get it -- he's a fascist asshole.
        (I don't think Trump has the discipline to be a true fascist. Authoritarian clown seems more apt.)
        But many "edgy" comedians and satirists not only support Hillary, they try to beautify or justify her grisly record.
        Hillary is backed by some of the worst reactionary war criminals alive, and yet to our "truth tellers," she's wonderful, if a bit flawed.
        What, you can do better?

        Hearing GM's "We take [security] very seriously" I wonder: has any company ever answered with "We do not take it seriously?" :)

        it's not that she has pneumonia, it's everything about what getting pneumonia says about her
        Dueling standards of proof:
        After all there's no reason to believe Wikileaks influenced by Russia, and every reason to believe Sweden fabricates rape for assassination.
        Unless you know a lot more about your bay leaves than I do about mine, the minimum amount you should add to any dish is "a whole fuckload".
        American kitchen bay leaves suck. It's not like you could meaningfully measure them; wildly variable.
        I am prepared to be corrected by someone who managed to ruin a dish with too many bay leaves but not holding my breath.
        Friday, day Clinton diagnosed w pneumonia, she appeared at 2 fundraisers, ran a 2-hour natl security mtg, did a presser, sat for CNN intvu
        If you haven't had pneumonia before: it's not like a bad cold; it's a motherfucker of a fever that won't go away and makes your heart race.
        On behalf, I am sure, of a number of people who have had pneumonia in the past: I can't believe HRC is managing to campaign through it
        She was diagnosed FRIDAY. Continued to campaign. It is now SUNDAY. WTF?https://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/775109439011430400 ... 
        .@patio11 Yes, "homeopathic" is the best term for what you get from ONE bay leaf. Don't ever use one.
        She has pneumonia. 
        One thing you learn Googling to see how many sick days Obama has taken:
        .@wikileaks deleted their tweet. Obviously in the nature of openness & transparency I have preserved it right here:pic.twitter.com/IdrgFlxP3A
        This all sounds reasonable but then you realize it's about a 40 hour delay in learning about a bout of pneumonia.https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/775158225306017792 ... 
        No pundit will be happy until this ends with HRC shouting in Latin in the National Cathedral. "You get Hoynes!"
        Starting to talk to startups about security in earnest. Are you a startups? If this is interesting to you, ping?
