        Getting into doing some kernel dev. Would you all recommend OSX and iOS Kernel Development? Also looking at Mac OSX Internals.
        Between the gyroscope and accelerometer, you often don't need a signal to track / cache a subject's location. Simple telemetry.
        Note the accelerometer is sensitive enough to deduce passwords with reasonable accuracy or your gait. Track your walking patterns? Sure.

        "Putin is puppet master!" conspiracy theorists are psychologically projecting Putin's infiltration of their own minds. Fascinating.
        Of course, many Putin Trojan Horsers are leveling the charges cynically (eg the Clinton campaign). But for others, psychological projection.

        Re #DNCleak: DNC efforts to shoot down Ken Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf's May 2 story in Politico about improper fundraising are troubling.
        It's actually kind of amazing. If you don't read Breitbart or the NY Post it's like it didn't happen.https://twitter.com/renejaspers/status/757219181842472960 ... 
        They're mentioning it but not diving into the substance of individual issues in the papers, e.g. the Vogel story.https://twitter.com/lollardfish/status/757220155785089024 ... 
        If this had been an RNC leak, there would be ten million stories. We're obligated to follow up the newsworthy stuff.https://twitter.com/lollardfish/status/757221937777086464 ... 
        By that logic we should ignore all negative stories about Democrats. Are you serious?https://twitter.com/minkastewart/status/757225324559994880 ... 
        Again, are you saying we shouldn't write negative stories about Democrats?https://twitter.com/minkastewart/status/757226275819753472 ... 
        If the DNC was essentially an arm of the Clinton campaign during primaries, yes, that is a major story.https://twitter.com/jdollarsign/status/757227987813085184 ... 
        Wow. Talk about false equivalences.https://twitter.com/minkastewart/status/757230468483813381 ... 
        When we only cover negative info on one side, we lose credibility with all sides.https://twitter.com/minkastewart/status/757230468483813381 ... 
        Truth matters, so we should ignore truths about Democrats? Huh?https://twitter.com/rsbarr/status/757238674635522050 ... 
        The false equivalency is that covering the DNC leaks is somehow like ignoring McCarthy.https://twitter.com/johnnychristo/status/757241314379304961 ...

        I know I shan't watch the Olympics this year. 
        Honestly, it's not been worth watching nor supporting for quite a long time - it's just nationalist nonsense.
        The absurd competition between various countries hoping to spend vast sums to "host" this farcical blunder is downright stupid.
        It drains the host countries' economies so that they can built Potemkin Olympic Villages and pretend their problems don't exist.
        And now it's bleedingly obvious that this is more a competition of which countries' bespoke pharmaceutical industries are best.
        [And great work, guys, y'all are spending megabucks on new steroids and ignoring actual health issues!]

        Then, perhaps, we can talk about "celebrating human achievement" rather than corp-sponsored pharmaceutical competitions.
