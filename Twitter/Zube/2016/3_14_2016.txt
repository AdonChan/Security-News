        My biggest fear is that Trump has set fires that he himself will be unable to extinguish even if he wants to.
        The Secret Police (Gestapo) eventually became Hitler's political protection, to take people into custody who protested Hitler's new agenda.
        If USSS is doing their job right, they'll be ignoring Trump and follow standard protocol. They seem to act as if working for him though.

        Important point. Even employees who no longer hold clearances, going to work for Apple, are still monitored by OPM https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/709017806306676736 ... 
        The irony of Comey asking about kidnapping Apple employees - likely made possible by data from the OPM breach.

        Creating backdoors that only run on one phone is like creating a bomb that will only explode over one country, just as dangerous if stolen.
        All of the protections Apple has for firmware controls are just a leash. A backdoor is still a bomb on a leash.

        They have Trump tied with Kasich in OH https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/03/12/poll-florida-ohio-illinois/ ...  and Marist has Kasich up 6 in Ohio http://maristpoll.marist.edu/313-trump-ahead-in-fl-il-kasich-up-in-oh-clinton-ahead-in-fl-il-and-oh/ ... 
        In every poll released so far on the weekend before the primary so far, YouGov has overestimated Trump's % of the vote I believe... (1/?)
        .@timwegener Based on everything I've seen, Clinton is likely to expand her delegate lead and by a lot on Tuesday thanks to FL and NC.
        Bottom line: Rubio likely to lose Florida. Kasich less likely though still a somewhat fav in my mind to win OH. Clinton up big in FL.
        Every single Florida poll has shown the same thing... Trump winning. I'd argue it'd be a bigger polling error than MI if Trump lost.

        A few thoughts follow on fostering the team culture you want.
        Don't just talk about the results.  Talk about how the team got the results.
        See counter culture behaviors? Don't just address in private. A public "we don't do that here" saves you 10x in private convos.
        Managers, most cynicism comes from feelings of disempowerment. Own the causes and work to address them.
        Wall-E is such a prophetic movie.

        I'm in Austin, and on a panel at #SXSW on Monday.  Obama warmed up the crowd for us yesterday. https://twitter.com/SaraSorcher/status/708694856600723457 ... 

        Thanks to the hugely talented (and hugely generous) @amandapalmer & Thor Harris for letting me squeeze in to their Austin show last night!
        One silver lining in Obama's SXSW crypto comments: in calling for a "solution", he at least acknowledges reality that none currently exists.
        It's obviously not as technically informed as I'd like, but it's much more nuanced than it could have been.
        Cue the false equivalence on violence at Trump events in 3, 2, 1...
        I know! Trump can hire the Hell's Angels to protect him at events. I hear they have experience managing large crowds.

        Slightly creepy: getting an email receipt for a merchant I never gave my email address to because they used Square to process my CC.
        I assume this is because I gave it to one merchant once.  Does Square share customer email addresses with other merchants?

        How much to value privacy and how much to trust gov't are valid political q's, but they aren't the core tech arguments for strong crypto.
        The core TECHNICAL issue is we simply don't know how to secure our infrastructure without strong crypto, or how to build secure backdoors.

        It's like the worst side of America is being amplified out of control.
        My biggest fear is that Trump has set fires that he himself will be unable to extinguish even if he wants to.
        The biggest risk is not that he wins, it's what he's normalizing.
