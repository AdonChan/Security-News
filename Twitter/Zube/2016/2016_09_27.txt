        Edward Snowden Receives German Citizen's Award 'Glass of Reason'
        Highly recommend this @jayrosen_nyu post on how the rise of Trump has fried the circuits of the mainstream press
        The Republican wing has become a living, breathing Overton Window, sucking the Democratic wing along in its diseased wake
        The candidates on Snowden--Espionage Act (Clinton), execution (Trump)--is a microcosm of the range of choice the duopoly offers America.

        What did center-left learn from center-right in the last thirty years? Privatization is far more acceptable when one calls it "innovation"
        This voice recognition thing I'm using is constantly turning "Blairite" into "playwright." Which, of course, is not entirely inaccurate.
        I'm still unsure if the Third (Fourth?) Industrial Revolution will disrupt Jeremy Rifkin's consulting business. It looks quite solid to me.

        I experienced this in childhood.  Foreclosure is a lifetime emotional event, leaves no one unmarked. Kids suffer. 1/https://twitter.com/lori_jablonski/status/780074099167023105 ... 
        Parents feel defeated, angry, shamed. Kids pick it up. Life feels precarious. Trouble in school follows. /2https://twitter.com/lori_jablonski/status/780074099167023105 ... 
        Kids enter new school with a secret -- 'We failed in the last place.'  New rental is always beat up and sad. /3https://twitter.com/lori_jablonski/status/780074099167023105 ... 
        I believe this is true, especially among those holding office.  But some conservs came from a fair amount of ruin.https://twitter.com/theo9873502/status/780088338904653824 ...
