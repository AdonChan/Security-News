        Yes, in fact, I do know that sushi is a type of rice and not fish per se. You are why the Internet can't have nice things.
        This is big: the full FBI alert with detailed indicators of hacked election databases https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/politics/images/boe_flash_aug_2016_final.pdf ... pic.twitter.com/AFj1oIS9Uj
        While there are ways to disrupt an election by compromising a statewide voter db, elections are generally run by indivdual counties. (1/2)
        So while this could, e.g., create uncertainty about who's registered, etc, it's unlikely to let them directly alter vote tallies.(2/2)
        Probably the most disruptive attack on an evoting system would be against the provisioning systems that creates the ballots shown to voters.
        If invalid ballots are shown to voters, there's almost no way to recover. But that's usually a county, not state, system.
        For a foreign state actor, hacks that disrupt an election & create chaos can be more valuable (& much easier) than altering winner.
        Bottom line on evoting vulnerabilities is these systems ARE dangerously vulnerable, but there's more to it than remotely attacking via 'net.
        The fact that we're now (apparently) seeing foreign state actors attacking our fragile evoting systems raises the stakes enormously.
        Perhaps the simplest strategy for a foreign state that wants to disrupt US elections is to probe & get caught, as apparently just happened.
        Evoting systems are sufficiently weak that just a credible probe by a foreign adversary may create enough uncertainty to create disruption.

        A few more thoughts on productivity. Even the most powerful people in the world feel corporations are out of control and poorly managed.
        Here's Warren Buffett, Larry Fink, and Jamie Dimon going public with their frustration at corporate management. http://www.governanceprinciples.org 
        Even the billionaire owners are saying that this system isn't working.
        The key point, which Warren Buffett falsely chalks up to natural causes, is the merger wave that cut the number of public companies in half.
        8000 public companies in 1996. Today there are 4000. That's a lot less competition.http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/business/dealbook/ceos-meet-in-secret-over-sorry-state-of-public-companies.html ... 
        If the 'owners' are frustrated with the companies they own, then they aren't actually owners. They are rent extractors.
        UK must pay for Brexit or EU is in 'deep trouble', says German ministerhttp://trib.al/sXPiKKo 
        Very interesting issues here. #antitrust #ABASALhttps://twitter.com/rainergrossmann/status/770141938825752576 ... 

        Again, the ownership class does not think the system is working for them.https://twitter.com/business/status/770285602864525312 ... 

        If no one is happy with governance of our system, then maybe... no one is actually in charge? Absentee ownership being the operative word.
        Here's Brandeis in 1933. https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/7752 
        "The chain store, by furthering the concentration of wealth/power and by promoting absentee ownership, is thwarting American ideals..."
        "That it is making impossible equality of opportunity; that it is converting independent tradesmen into clerks..."
        and that it is sapping the resources, the vigor and the hope of the smaller cities and towns.." Sound familiar?

        ... because obviously if one does 'rpm -i <untrusted_rpm>' without prior 'rpm -K' (verify sig), then this is already a Game Over (TM).
        Obviously 'rpm -i' means: take this rpm and execute whatever scripts it has. As root.
        @rootkovska I was unable to trigger them before signature, however it may be, but my main point is a different one

        My absolute most very-favorite pro-DNSSEC argument: it's OK that the roots use RSA-1024, because TLDs use RSA-2048.
        I know, I know, it's subtle. Takes a second to realize the flaw in the logic. Think about it and you'll see.
        It's 2H'2016 and DNSSEC advocates are gloating that they've at least got the replacement of RSA-1024 scheduled.https://twitter.com/letoams/status/770322909978062848 ...
