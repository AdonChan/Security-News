        Just like SysWoW64 contains 32-bit code and System32 64-bit, the new Linux subsystem for Windows is called "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
        Good news, as of 4.11, strace compiles out of the box on musl for some archs, needs 1-line patch for most other archs.
        In strace's ptrace.h:
        Yay for the generic transfer_one_message in Linux's spi layer: @ 50 MHz cpu clock, it spends 10% of SPI I/O time recording useless stats.
        Simply C&P'ing it to the J-core SPI driver and removing all the accounting & crap boosted transfer speeds by 10%.
        If anyone has a chance to test that this patch is safe for glibc, uclibc, etc. too let me know:https://twitter.com/RichFelker/status/724095513813983232 ...

        Sleet in Meyrin on 24th April...  @MeteoSvizzera is infallible, once again.
        On the 24th April 1986, 30 yrs ago, the last normal day at Chernobyl power station. The engineers were dreaming up the "safety experiment"... 
        and the Ð ÐµÐ°ÐºÑ‚Ð¾Ñ€ Ð‘Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÑˆÐ¾Ð¹ ÐœÐ¾Ñ‰Ð½Ð¾ÑÑ‚Ð¸ ÐšÐ°Ð½Ð°Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹ 1000 positive void coefficient was ready to strike.
        People either forget or don't know the Chernobyl disaster started off as a "safety experiment" to see if the residual power of spinning... 
        down turbines would be sufficient to power the reactor back up. Didn't quite work as expected.
        Several security interlocks had to be disabled for the safety experiment, despite the (mainly) Western credence of "inherently unsafe"... 
        Soviet design. What was unsafe was that the experiment was continued despite several signs that it was not going well. Arrogance is... 
        international and the engineers thought they could master a reactor which was already saying "please stop now".
