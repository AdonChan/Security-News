        Where was all this liberal outrage about the Electoral College in '08 and '12?
        Many liberals remain pissed off and shell shocked, but I've seen younger  liberals now talking about radical resistance to Trump. Good.
        Despite younger libs/progs looking for a more radical solution, older liberals have found the cause of Trump's victory: Susan Sarandon.
        Their solution? Don't build a resistance to Trump. Boycott Susan Sarandon movies! #WinningStrategy
        Right now in NYC. This is the spirit. #FuckTrumppic.twitter.com/oVorw7PLdE

        Trump is a consummate bullshitter, but since he says "I will deport illegals and X-treme vet muslims," it's prudent to act like he means it

        1/ If Trump wins I am announcing and funding a legitimate campaign for California to become its own nation.
        2/Most patriotic thing to do is to questioning idea of a federation of states  & calling a new constitutional convention for systemic change
        3/It's the most patriotic thing we can do. Country is at serious crossroads. 
        4/As 6th largest economy in world, economic engine of nation, provider of a large % of federal budget, California carries a lot of weight.
        5/We need to have serious national dialogue about our culture, values & rampant sexism, racism and hate that Trump campaign has exposed.
        6/ Calling for a temporary withdrawal of support during the dark Trump Presidency. Re-entry after a constitutional convention convened.
        7/Removing Electoral College would be one of changes needed. Small states with little diversity shouldn't determine Presidency.

        On the plus side, Vice President Pence! That's pretty exciting stuff, right?
        Huge airstrikes in #Sanaa right now.
        I owe Trump an apology for this: I was wrong to believe he wouldn't accept the results of the election
        Another bright side: we're finally going to see filibuster reform!
        Let's give dynastic politics one more shot. Michelle Obama in 2020
        Nickname suggestion: the Teflon Don
        I bet Obama takes out his frustration by not pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey
        Journalists are starting to write articles about some of Trump's policy proposals, an interesting new approach for the media
        "Amid a world of problems, Trump's foreign policy prescriptions are opaque" explains the Washington Post. YOU HAD ONE JOB
        NYT headline "World Is About to Learn What Trump Believes In." Just plain trolling now. Remember when the entire front page was about email?

        After Iraq WMDs, Katrina, the housing crash, and Trumps win, I, for one, still trust the "experts"
        The ACLU assessed Trump's unconstitutional proposals, and is ready if he tries to implement them as president.https://www.aclu.org/feature/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis ...

        Philly protests seem to be dispersing now.  A few thousand people marching; peaceful with no confrontations or arrests as far as I know.
        Be safe, everyone. We all need to be around and engaged for the next four years.
        Like them or not, the investigative journalism of @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @wsj, @propublica, etc is more critically important than ever.https://twitter.com/kpoulsen/status/796428126267940864 ...

        It's particularly unfortunate that climate issues were ignored in debates. By the time it transcends partisan politics, it will be too late.
        My personal expertise is computer security & crypto, but while there are important policy issues there, it's nothing compared with climate.
        Sorry, but if your reaction to a complex scientific question is "but what do scientists know?", the answer is usually "more than you do".
        Scientists disagree about things all the time (that's part of science). Most fields aren't fully understood. Doesn't mean science is "wrong"

        If Russia's goal is to destabilize/sow discord, claiming to have coordinated with Trump is exactly the right strategy, whether true or not.
        Which is to say, I strongly dislike Trump, but that doesn't mean all bad things about him should be accepted uncritically.
        If Hillary had won, Russia could achieve similar result by saying "We helped her win by arranging for her to have a weak opponent"
        Of course, it could be true. I don't know any more than anyone else.
        Well, we elected someone who's both a New Yorker and a Penn alum. I suppose that should make me feel good.

        I'm not sure I understand this stuff about "giving him a chance". He was elected President. That gives him a pretty big chance right there.

        This is an excellent, illuminating explanation of how the Democrats lost the plot in the economy from the 70s on.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/796336605430738946 ... 
        Amid all the analysis of the Clinton loss don't forget the Dems hold almost no state legislatures/govs. Problem is much deeper
        I want to make one point about contemporary Germans tut-tutting about U.S. politics right now. These Germans do not know history.
        If they did, they would recognize that their MASSIVE trade surplus and mercantilism is causing destabilization all over the world.
        They would see not TV politics but a global financial and trade architecture similar to that in the 1920s that destabilized their country.
        And they would see that they are playing the role of France or the U.S. in refusing to redress balances as a creditor nation.
        The Germans do not see that the U.S.'s importer of last resort role - a role that they rely on - has destroyed the American middle class.
        The rise of populist/authoritarian politics is preceded by imbalanced debt and trading relationships. The problems are Germany and China.
        Obviously there's a lot more to the story. But Germany's mercantilism has helped lead to Brexit, the Greek depression, and in some way this.

        Interesting that the Dow - old economy - up on Trump win, vs NASDAQ - Silicon Valley - not doing so well.
        I think Dems should choose 3 issues on which they can work with Trump: Huge infrastructure spending, dealing w/monopolies, and fixing trade.

        Lessons from this election season: 
        3) It isn't that fact checking didn't change minds. It's that the minds that needed to be changed were not reading the fact checks.
        4) if you put a camera on someone and let them talk unchallenged for nearly two years, that's reality tv, not news.
        5) This more than any other was the Marshal McLuhan election. Hot media won. Trump painted with emotions, and cold facts were thrown aside
        6) When you let a scorpion (paid campaign proxies) ride your back across the river, you're gonna get stung.
        7) The greatest enemy of democracy is ennui.
        8) Never deny the legitimate anger of people who have been left behind by growth that happens only at the top.
        One factor nobody has mentioned yet: how Clinton studiously avoided directly talking to media during campaign, and how that bred mistrust.

        Something that helps: muting for a month anyone who RT's Trump's most egregious supporters onto my TL. I don't need to see it.
        My pile-on contribution:
        The one deterrent to abuses under next administration would be plausible threat of prosecution. But: nope, no precedent.
        Obama has used the tools of the surveillance state judiciously, which makes the situation much worse, because it masks their full power

        Same for founders in the midwest as anywhere else: have zero tolerance for racism and misogyny. 
        Secession is significantly more despicable than Trump. The people voted. The idea that we deserve better in CA is part of the problem.
