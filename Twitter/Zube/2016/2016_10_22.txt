        Downtime due to DNS is the most unnecessary. Caching resolvers should serve hot stale records by default. Sites should have secondary DNS.
        Running and defending a DNS server is not easy ( hugs to @Dyn), trust me I know. But sites should not go down like this. It's frustrating.
        There is no reason a SERVFAIL is a better answer than a stale cached record. Secondaries are easy. DNS is essentially resiliency best-case.
        Take this intuition. Now ask, "why doesn't my DNS resolver just remember the IPs that worked 1h ago?" NO GOOD REASONhttps://twitter.com/homakov/status/789508143130742784 ... 
        Any website would take stale IPs over downtime. Nobody relies on fast DNS changes anyway, everything is cacheable (DNS is bestcase) </rant>

        Pro-tip: OpenDNS users generally see the Internet as they should. We do a good job of handing "last known good" IPs when we can't resolve.

        Politicians doing comedy in front of an audience of clerics = comedy hell. Only way to make it worse would be to have an Al Jolson dinner.

        @baconmeteor a way to make it better would be a Weird Al dinner.

        @bobmcmillan indirectly it was. Their AWS us-east-1 region and much (all?) of Amazon retail DNS is 100% managed by Dyn, who was DDoS'd.

        DDoS attack hits Dyn, causing outages or slowness at Twitter, among many other sites. My take and analysis https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/ ... 
        as predicted, we're now seeing a bunch of 2017 security prediction stories. so predictable, so useless.

        Then, along with Itanium, the "high end" Xeons got it too. Now TSX was an interesting departure from Tandem's "lockstep" design which ... 
        dates back to the Cyclone, the MIPS and the Alpha evolutions. The Itanium would *not* run lockstep but rely on TSX to ensure integrity.

        Dirty Cow: a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux Kernel (a branded vulnerability with a sense of humor) http://dirtycow.ninja/ 
        I don't get all the fuss about the "Dirty COW" vulnerability. If someone had local access, you already have many attack vectors.
        Yes, you need to patch & fix that CVE.
        But the "seriousness" of that CVE depends heavily on your setup and what you already expose to the outside.
        The idea that "a SQL injection could trigger root access" requires several *intermediate* exploits before it's viable.
        You're still better off patching all your WordPress & Drupal sites.
        For reference, I'm talking about CVE-2016-5195 also branded as "Dirty COW": http://dirtycow.ninja/

        Also - this is why $bigcompany should be distributing DNS not only across servers, but companies.
        Thanks to having a configuration that uses distributed DNS resolvers, I can ;-)https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/789522816685187073 ...

        your decision to manage /etc/hosts manually has finally paid off
        Ironically, $TWTR shares are up today. Perhaps if the company is down for the next 13 months it can get back to its IPO price.

        OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 -- useful if you can't resolve hostnames at the moment
        Once is happenstance.
        the word 'freelancer' originally came from medieval knights who would kill evildoers for the king and THEN NOT GET PAID FOR EIGHT MONTHS
        .......this is not a reasonable failure condition.https://twitter.com/ow/status/789515155877027840 ... 
        @munin so, so, so many gaps in consideration around product and service design. Failure modes, especially.
        .@nicatronTg No, OpenDNS dropped NXDOMAIN monetization.

        When I was younger I'd have said that how you write and what you say were as independent as shape and color. But that's not true.
        I can imitate Gibbon's style of writing, but if I do it makes me say different things.
        And if different writing styles make you say different things, that raises interesting questions.
        Are there styles that make you smarter, or more honest? Because if so you should consciously seek them out.

theproperwords

        1/The real question at the centre of all of this has to be: how does the U.S. restore balance after #Trump and #Election2016?
        2/Is there any way that the Trump or Republican contingent can come to an agreement on anything? Will Washington respond or rebuke?
        3/A rebuke only further alienates the pols from people and the people from pols. The media can be the bridge, but not with profit in mind.
        4/Thus we come down to the basic issue at hand: the U.S. is being tested and no one is prepared to respond accordingly.
        5/Money and its influence is to blame here, primarily. When few people hold power, the rest are left out in the cold.
        6/ Trump supporters might not all be poor whites, but there is a broad consensus that the system isn't working for anyone, really.
        7/ At what point does this become unsustainable? What happens when a more disciplined, Trump-like fascist emerges in an election year?
        8/ Unrest will give way to further disaffection and there will be duelling protests, inter-party violence, and complete distrust of gov't.
        9/If Washington and pols decide to ignore this while enriching themselves, they make it look like a sinking ship. Stripping it bare.
        10/That leaves a crumbling infrastructure, permanently damaged institutions, and a cynical public all left to sort through the remains.
        11/The American Experiment is valid, worthwhile, and necessary. It has to grow and evolve. But that isn't happening here. It's being choked.
        12/How this all ends up? I don't know. But either way it's not going to be pretty. November 9th is Day One. Day Two? We'll see.
