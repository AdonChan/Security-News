        One of the good things about modern times: If you die horribly on television, you will not have died in vain. You will have entertained us.
        I feel and think much as you do,care about many of the things you care about,although most people don't care about them. You are not alone.
        There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too.

        I loved the Avengers. But the structure of the industry is pushing everything that way. Scale scale scale. Innovation gets cut out.
        Best analogy is the lobster industry. Maine allows families to own one boat. So China can buy the lobster itself, but not the industry.
        Here's a piece on Maine's lobster industry. Obvious the rules for movies would be different, but the point remains.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/15/this-tiny-american-town-is-staking-its-future-on-chinese-foodies/ ... 
        Without protections in place to keep Hollywood supply chain independent, you get concentrations of views. Then, foreign control.

        My point is that American politicians are not elected to raise the wages of foreign workers.https://twitter.com/mihirssharma/status/762295641645125632 ... 
        And it's progressive to employ workers at factories where workers have no political freedoms? https://twitter.com/mihirssharma/status/762296798010630148 ... 
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html ... https://twitter.com/citizenxiv/status/762297780400328704 ... 
        If our companies are moving their manufacturing operations there, how are we not complicit?https://twitter.com/mihirssharma/status/762297751472369664 ... 
        Please tell me that was an ironic use of the word "richer."https://twitter.com/mihirssharma/status/762299721855696896 ... 
        Right. All those in favor of expiring jobs to slave-labor havens abroad are really advocates for the foreign poor.https://twitter.com/nikhil_can/status/762300843139956736 ... 
        @mtaibbi this is one of my favorite arguments: that outsourcing labor is more or less a form of charity. the cynicism is truly staggering
        Does that "long run" include first undercutting domestic workers' rights and suppressing domestic wages?https://twitter.com/chn_adamwodon/status/762302686490402816 ... 
        When the "free market" came to Russia, I toured the country working new jobs, precisely to see their experiences.https://twitter.com/nikhil_can/status/762303880659099648 ... 
        So domestic voters should vote down their own rights and wages in favor of a "net global gain" down the road?https://twitter.com/albiegf13/status/762305002111131648 ... 
        Have never once defended the Soviet Union. But the system that replaced it was brutal in its own way.https://twitter.com/mdpetrucelli/status/762305844948111360 ... 
        I studied in the Soviet Union. There are aspects of it that people miss. But overall it was a dumpster fire.https://twitter.com/prema46/status/762308627717840897 ... 
        What? I think global trade and integration are inevitable and necessary. We just can't support oppressive regimes.https://twitter.com/nikhil_can/status/762309420097409025 ... 
        I don't see how middle-class voters should vote not only to sacrifice, but to give their bosses more gains.https://twitter.com/jefffreyspies/status/762311093939298304 ... 
        @nikhil_can @mtaibbi @mihirssharma yes because the ideal way to develop poor countries is by erecting sweat shops to undercut wealthy ones.
        @mtaibbi @jefffreyspies "Fire me so I can live in poverty, someone in China can live in slightly better poverty, and you get a mansion."
        Are you saying building factories in China is humanist?https://twitter.com/johnchalloran/status/762313120396275712 ... 
        @mtaibbi shouldn't we be using our economic power to force countries into better labor practices?
        Right, because of the raging humanism of the employers bringing jobs there.https://twitter.com/davidmanheim/status/762314857668640768 ... 
        Forgive me for laughing at the notion that exporting jobs to China is "humanist."https://twitter.com/doublee31/status/762317065206149120 ...
