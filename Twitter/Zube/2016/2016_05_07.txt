        2010: "I know I'll take over Group Policy and push out my security policies!"
        I started in IT Helpdesk, and I thought I had it bad.
        When I was in helpdesk I believed the crap that full-of-shit IT ppl said on forums. I was worthless. I wasn't important. I wasn't skilled.
        Even now I'm a little ashamed to even say I was in Helpdesk instead of being a super-wizard whose first job was Sr. Software Architect.
        The only crap you hear growing up in Silicon Valley is the super engineer geniuses making 200k at 22 years old. Anything less is garbage.
        @SwiftOnSecurity my first official security job was a roving graveyard-shift security guard at a seasonal condo complex in wintry Vermont.
        Anyway, sorry for dumping on you. I hated myself for years. I wish someone would have told me that what I did mattered. That I was an equal.
        How effective are web security firewalls at preventing infection of unpatched clients within 1 day of a patch being released? How reliable?
        Once a patch installed, filtering a vulnerability is effectively pointless, so the only value in filter is slack between release and patch.
        See that story about 272 million accounts hacked? It's false.
        I have little tolerance for hyped threats. "What's the harm? It warns people."

        "Image" has 4 meanings in computers:
        There's no reason Windows couldn't hotpatch most anything without rebooting, however they don't because there are risks. Being conservative.
        Rather than have programs running mismatched library versions, Microsoft determined a reboot is a better choice to maintain consistency[2/2]
        Ultimately, uptime only measures the duration since you last proved you can turn the machine on and have it boot.
        @SwiftOnSecurity I heard an MSFT employee say "We're pretty sure it'll work without rebooting but we're 100% sure it will if you reboot".
        The historical emphasis on "uptime" is highly rooted in the mainframe model of a highly reliable and available, centralized machine.
        @SwiftOnSecurity this is (relatively) new. The cost of having redundant nodes was historically exorbitant so single node uptime mattered
