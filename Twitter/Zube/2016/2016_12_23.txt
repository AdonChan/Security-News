        Yemen's crisis is severe, attention & aid lacking. To match donations: zeynep at http://technosociology.org . To donate: http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/zeynep pic.twitter.com/VHvB15qSwK
        Dude, they claim you're in cahoots with Russian intel because you fled there and live in exile there. It's not crazyhttps://twitter.com/Snowden/status/811963786101932032 ... 

        I don't believe @snowden is working with Russian intelligence, but it seems weird to treat it as some kind of crazy conclusion to jump to
        Another match for  $2,600 for this campaign in support of @MSF efforts in Yemen. Collectively raised almost $70K.  http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/zeynep 
        First, read three-time Pulitzer-winner @BartonGellman's takedown of several documented, provably false claims:https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/ ... 
        There are 6 claims in the Barton Gellman story Snowden cites that Gellman rebutted. They are:
        If you can afford it, please volunteer to match donations for @zeynep's MSF Yemen fundraiser. Keep it going strong! http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.personalCampaign&participantID=3834 ...

        @Pinboard Another $2,500 (anon) match, and one more being set up. Gifts for kids; cold hard cash for teens; donations for adults.
        .@whoojemaflip is matching for $2,500 & an anon donor for another $2,500. Your donations are being doubled.  http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/zeynep 
        Let's try to get $100K raised for Yemen. Pledge matching funds to @zeynep if you can, and please donate any amount. http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.personalCampaign&participantID=3834 ... 
        Donations are matched up to $31,600, past that @zeynep will need more generous matchers. Nearly $70K raised so far. http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.personalCampaign&participantID=3834 ... 
        I didn't really expect to stumble across horse-detection news for @Pinboard in my archaeology feeds, but here we arehttps://twitter.com/botarchaeo/status/811994600273346560 ... 

        My life goal is to be footnote #1 in "Champing At The Bits: A History of Algorithmic Horse Detection"
        One more anon match, from a previous donor.  *wipes eyes*. New matched goal: $33,600. http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/zeynep 
        With one tweet the other day I screwed up the math on @zeynep's fundraiser, so it's non-trivial to calculate the total donated from the goal
        Crypto people, I encourage you to find an integer overflow in this formula, and exploit it by donating.https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/812001747635945472 ... 

        @zeynep @Pinboard ok, we (@asquera) will match for 1000 EUR. Shoot me an email to info@asquera.de where I should send the funds and receipt
