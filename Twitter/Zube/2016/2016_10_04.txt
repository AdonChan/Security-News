        Donald Trump*: Making Late Night TV Great Again
        So apparently, uh, this tweet was meant as a celebration, not a lament...https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/172772609627394049 ... 
        Activist: "I'm mad u only scrutinize Clinton!" 
        Enjoyed this from @susannecraig - especially abt the fact check/verification. Its a nerve-wracking part of this jobhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/insider/the-time-i-found-donald-trumps-tax-records-in-my-mailbox.html?_r=0 ... 
        Interesting opinion. Of course, some others believe that her pivotal support for a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people is worse. https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/782682763757391872 ... 
        Journalistic scrutiny of Clinton proves the journalist wants Trump to win. Additionally, war is peace and freedom is slavery.
        Here's a really emblematic response to basic journalist scrutiny of Clinton. Quite illustrative. https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/782685843102142464 ... 
        Journalistic scrutiny of Clinton is proof the journalist is "threatened by a powerful woman." Also, I'm told that ignorance is strength. https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/782686016939307008 ... 
        Because its journalists' job to scrutinize all the candidates. That this must be explained says so much abt how ignorant society has become.https://twitter.com/chrishvt/status/782687808930586624 ... 
        This is right. The media/political class is OK with lying. It is offended by Trump's particular kind of lying.https://theintercept.com/2016/09/26/donald-trump-leads-the-war-on-truth-but-he-didnt-start-it/ ... 
        I like how providing context about both candidates is now derided as "false equivalence." What an Orwellian innovation.
        These are obviously Very Serious Expertshttps://theintercept.com/2016/07/25/robert-kagan-and-other-neocons-back-hillary-clinton/ ... 
        If you dare question anything from Team Clinton, it must automatically mean you
        Personally, I'm voting for @Farenthold. Screw that guy Sirota.https://twitter.com/gbantiquer/status/782709919539720192 ... 
        Which is better?
        I could not disagree more. Twitter -- and progressive media -- are one huge 24-7 rolling denunciation of Trump.https://twitter.com/Johngcole/status/782710939007062016 ... 
        "You're either us or with the terrorists" - this Bush doctrine has basically become the mantra of both Trump supporters & Clinton supporters
        Millennials are like, "Wait, what's a newspaper?"https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/782770554252234752 ...

        Trump tax is a rare (but maybe increasingly common) case of docs thrown over transom w/o reporter IDing source.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/insider/the-time-i-found-donald-trumps-tax-records-in-my-mailbox.html ... 
        I wonder if the story would have ever run (with source anon to reporter) if the accountant hadn't been willing to talk.
        Little known fact: in order to collect his inheritance, Trump was required to lose at least $900 million in a single year.
        This is the time of year that I inevitably find urgent needs for things that only @BHPhotoVideo carries. Plan ahead.
        Sending docs anonymously is a hard technical problem, but not as hard as the problem the reporter will have authenticating the docs.
        It's a rare combination of luck & hard investigative reporting that the Trump tax story made it to print, given the way the docs were sent.
        If we're talking about fulfilling fiduciary duties to one's investors, perhaps not losing $900 million would be a good start.

        The backstory on the privacy of tax returns is interesting. It was a fight in the 1920s b/n Andrew Mellon and progressives.
        I'm going off memory so the details might be a bit off, but essentially progressives wanted all big $$$ and corporate tax returns public.
        WWI had created this enormous tax bureaucracy and this repository of corporate data. And big corporations had made billions in the war.
        Mellon, as Secretary of Treasury and 3rd richest man in the country, fought for tax rebates, tax reductions, and tax privacy.
        Today we just accept the privacy of corporate and billionaire tax returns as the way things should be. But that was not true in the 1920s.
        @matthewstoller older than this. Goes back to Civil War. Used to be posted on courthouse doors.
        It was a fight w/robber barons. The SEC Act includes protecting taxing power as one of its mandates. https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf ... 
        NEW: Read new policies on consumer protection & monopoly power that @HillaryClinton is speaking about NOW in Toledo: https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/updates/2016/10/03/hillary-clintons-vision-for-an-economy-where-our-businesses-our-workers-and-our-consumers-grow-and-prosper-together-2/ ... 
        Amid all the news, worth paying attention to new Econ ideas in Hillary's speech today, eg responding to rising market concentration.
        Two interesting rhetoric choices in HRC's competition policy. One, Clinton rejects the permissive Reagan era model of antitrust enforcement.
        Two, Clinton presumes concentrated market structure is harmful rather than having to prove it case by case. https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/10/03/hillary-clintons-vision-for-an-economy-where-our-businesses-our-workers-and-our-consumers-grow-and-prosper-together/ ... 
        If implemented this would be a striking change to merger policy and antitrust enforcement.
        Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont, (and sort of Syngenta-ChemChina) would definitely have a tougher time with a market presumption standard.
        Haven't read briefing yet, but if this is accurate, would be huge challenge for Silicon Valley.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/783001556098621440 ... 
        This signals a big change in terms of the thought behind competition policyhttps://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian/status/783004810677194752 ... 
        .@HillaryClinton commits to strong antitrust enforcement, scrutinizing M&A, taking on monopoly power and promoting competition in Toledo.
        The concentration of our food supply - seeds, chemicals, dairy, fertilizer, grain distribution, meatpacking, supermarkets - it's shocking.

        Repeatedly reloading the seat map because I am paranoid I am going to lose this row I have to myself
        Last time this happened someone sat there immediately before takeoff, got hammered, took Ambien and then punched me in the face repeatedly
        Backstory involved his girlfriend having left him for a Brazilian international football player and him wanting me to hack her Facebook
        Morning conversation:
        I love flying
        Anyway I told him that maybe he should consider therapy and then got the fuck out
        Meanwhile dude just tried to steal the seat next to the woman in front and she shut him down hard
        (not the face punch dude, for clarity)
        i am going to trigger some millennials tomorrow by walking around dressed as a blue passport!!!! read my column

        If my employer is following my Twitter posts, my comments should in no way be construed as a desire to unionize.

        So far, the best case I've heard for voting for Trump is: "If he wins, the revolution will come faster."

        These deplorable Trump followers are so small-minded and self-deluded that it would be comical if they weren't also so aggressively hateful.
        Strange how Trump & his supporters project onto others: they insist that everyone else is indignant, sanctimonious, and hateful. Uh, really?

        Business idea: physical anti-data-exfiltration firewalls!
        Something like https://www.hotelwifitest.com/  is the community alternative, but doesn't really work well (not enough properties, no feedback.)

        Trump campaign advisor and top 10 contender for most odious person in US politics Roger Stone claims to be working with Wikileaks.
        Roger Stone is probably not lying about that.
        Looking forward to seeing if this is really the moment where Wikileaks straight up makes something up to try to move the election to Trump.
