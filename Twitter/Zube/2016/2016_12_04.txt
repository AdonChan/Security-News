        Press. The door flies open. She turns into the room, raises the rifle, and the world slows as she trades cognition for perception of time.
        Cortana fires for center mass, tap.... wait for next image, assess, adjust. At this speed of thought, her eyes function like still-cameras.
        Two shots in center mass, arms raise the barrel for the kill. An ejected cartridge still tumbles away, as slow as if air was crystalline oil
        The bolt carrier slams forward and locks. The machine of thought pulls the trigger of the machine of destruction it wields. A round exits.
        A deep roar screams, and Cortana re-paces her perception to default clock. The training horn silences. 
        The target had two holes.
        Eventually, they would prefer when she was only a pen.

        Trump's refusal to consult with State Dept experts yields its serious diplomatic incident.https://www.ft.com/content/fd19907e-b8d4-11e6-961e-a1acd97f622d ... 
        When I mentioned that these calls involve subtle signaling, Twitter experts assured me I had no idea what I was talking about.
        "China, just screw them" may work as a rally applause line, but probably does not optimize US interests as foreign policy.
        It may make sense to anger China, but if so, we should do it on purpose.
        He was telling the truth when he said the only "expert" he listens to is himself.
        Trump supporters have made me see the error of my ways by pointing out that I'm a stupid beta libtard. Logic and reason carries the day.
        Had a great time at @BSidesPhilly - thanks for putting up wth me.
        Out-maneuvered by Taiwan before even taking office. Way to go, Mr. master negotiator.
        The part that he doesn't get, that he urgently needs to get, Is that none of this is personal or about him anymore. He represents the US.
        So when "he" gets a call from a foreign leader, it isn't for him, it's for the office he holds. Someone needs to explain this to him.
        After a couple weeks with the new macbook pro, I've re-trained my vi fingers to use ctl-] for escape. Touchbar esc useless for touchtyping.

        24. It is ALSO how the Clinton and Obama frameworks were organized. There is a difference though b/n them and Trump.
        25. The way that neoliberals deliver social justice is through the dole, or what we call Obamacare, transfer payments, job training.
        26. This is a variant of humiliating people with charity. It is explicitly not what the party of the people was about.
        27. Paul Krugman's "Let them eat transfer payments" is the slight of hand he always plays with events like Carrier.
        28. They are voting against their self-interest. But their self-interest isn't the dole! They want jobs! They want self-government.
        29. Trump is pitching not self-government, but a wall to protect them against neoliberals and a strongman to mock their enemies.
        30. It's not really what they want. Trump was not popular. But it's their version of the neoliberal deal of symbolic racial diversity.
        31. The ignorance is a choice, a choice that your facts don't matter. Just like you've decided that foreclosures/offshoring doesn't matter.
        32. The thing is, neoliberalism and Trumpism are BOTH incompatible with self-government, except among a select few. Few want either.
        33. Until we can recognize that it is concentrated financial power - monopoly - extending power over all of us, we will dance to their tune.

        Is there a recommended newsletter for Microsoft related tools & technologies, like what @CronWeekly does for Linux? Focus on tech.
        I feel like I'm missing out on knowing about a lot of interesting tech coming from Microsoft (or the MS ecosystem).
        No marketing BS, focus on technical articles and summaries. For geeks.

        Here's my new awesome idea: since SSL 1.0 was never published, decrement the major number, so that the new one is TLS 0.3.
        Some smart people on TLS-WG are advocating for "SSL 4". But they're protocol nerds. They need more marketing input:http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades-11056 ... 
        "SSL 1000". What'll people say? Mew mew mew. Oh, no, what will people say?! Grow the fuck up. When you're on top, people talk.
        Stop. I just had a stroke of genius. Open your mouth, baby birds, cause Mama's about to drop you one sweet, fat nightcrawler: SSSL.
