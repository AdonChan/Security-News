        I am expecting there will be an escalating series of SWIFT-based thefts in the next year: https://www.sec.uno/2016/05/16/inter-bank-system-swift-on-security-user-manual-needs-revamp-the-register/?utm_content=32601319&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter ... 
        So, this is summat I've been working on putting into long-form for a while, but:
        Basically, once it's written down, a standard has to wait for the next revision to evolve.
        And if there's one thing that we know about best practices, it's that they have to be changed regularly.
        Standards like the SWIFT handbook are based on a distillation of expertise at a given point in time.
        They are reactive - and once published, cannot anticipate new developments.
        Worse, they inform non-specialty experts' activities, who then have to be retrained on new standards when they come out.
        So the whole thing ends up compounding, and you get layers on layers of differential capabilities across an industry.
        But it's all "compliant with the standard"
        Keep that in mind when you read about SWIFT incidents - when was the security standard written, and how have attacks evolved since?

        MS didn't consider UMCI to be a sec boundary meaning Device Guard probably isn't either. e.g. cdb is an easy vector.https://twitter.com/subTee/status/733345042434117632 ... 
        @passingthehash I honestly don't think MS would be able to define what is and what isn't a boundary for all of their technologies.

        Sadly, the presented approaches seem either: 1) lead to a platform DoS, or 2) require asking ME to disable itself.https://twitter.com/_deepfire/status/734005224948523008 ... 
        And it's rather dubious to rely on Intel ME to disable itself: if we trust it that much, then why not assume it simply is non-harmful to us?
        ... not to mention Intel can patch any of these "ask ME to disable itself" interfaces in no time...

        First attempt Cooking Issues french fries (1hr .4% SPL soak, 14m blanch 3% salt, double fry). Good; too salty. Uniformly crunchy.
        As JKLA predicted, full 14m blanch broke fries to bits (they still fried into decent short fries). 11m blanch better, for thin fries.
        No one fry was, like, revelatory, but the consistency among all the fries was impressive. Will try again.
        Ok also 45 minutes later and they are still crunchy. That's interesting.
