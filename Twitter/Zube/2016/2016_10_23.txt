        One way to regulate: if IoT device is hacked, vendor must fix remotely via update or issue full product recall. Will incentivize vendors.

        Once your bugs reach a certain level of subtleness, the (manual) bug finding process changes from a deductive to a constructive process.
        Instead of going: "D'oh, another bounds check missing" you start building hypotheses on how to reach certain code paths.
        In a way building a PoC can feel a like very direct proof construction in math.

        Hacked Cameras, DVRs Powered Today's Massive Internet Outage https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/ ... 
        One way to regulate: if IoT device is hacked, vendor must fix remotely via update or issue full product recall. Will incentivize vendors.
        DDoS by IoT devices is only going to get worse as everyone becomes directly connected via IPv6. IPv4 has implicit security via NAT.
        In facf, the shortage of publicly routable IPv4 addresses means more NAT'ing, which means less new directly reachable IoT devices.
        Granted, not ever IoT devices gets hacked via plain-ol-telnet and weak passwords, but it's got to be the majority.
        So while it isn't a security feature, getting all your devices at home NAT'd will make you less prone for IoT hacks.
        I should write a blogpost titled 'This One Weird Trick Will Protect Your IoT Home From Getting Hacked' and all it does is link to a router.

        Users need to be able to update their device firmware. Today's attacks show copyright anti-circumvention laws threaten key infrastructure.
        Striking anti-circumvention laws like Â§1201 from the books isn't on its own sufficient to fix IoT security problems, but it's necessary.

        It's estimated that there's around 500,000 devices vulnerable to the attack used to create this botnet. There's over 8 billion IoT devices.
        Even if we ensure 99.99% of IoT devices have no vulnerabilities, that's enough to create an equally bad botnet in future.
        Improving IoT security is vital for protecting individual end users, but that's not going to be how we protect internet infrastructure

        As @cstross mentioned, the manufacturers will just generate ablative corps to soak any regulatory fines and go on doing their thing.
        Perhaps the FTC could attempt to restrict the sales of devices, but given the sheer volume, it'll make drug trials look simple.
        It's going to be a losing battle from day 1, and nothing good will derive from this.
        2 is an absolute non-starter because, simply put, users cannot be expected to be network administrators.
        ISPs may be pressured to take a few basic measures, but by and large, as they currently are, there's really no pressure for them to do owt.
        After all, if a user's toaster starts DDoSing and overruns the user's data cap, the ISP profits.
        So 2 ain't happening - at least not without massive changes in how the user-ISP-vendor relationships work.
        3 is probably going to be pretty likely. We already have certain examples of disparate, special-purpose networks.
        Think 'internet2' in the academia world, or 'SWIFT' for banking - limited access between that and elsewhere; run under different rules.
        Entirely plausible to see various corps grabbing dark fiber to have specific interconnects with their supply chains.
        And since these aren't ISPs - it's not an internet service; more like an extended WAN - the rules of neutrality and openness don't apply.
        So we end up with a fractured set of walled gardens with different access requirements, which is -incredibly- cyberpunk but depressing.
        4 is the most fun - someone gets a clue, and the CFAA gets neutered enough so botnets are attackable.
        Then we get all those pentesters who are hanging around between gigs into a public service org to  neuter botnet nodes.
        It'll be a royal mess and probably develop into a competitive sport.
        So - what d'ye reckon will be the final tally?

        If you use GOST, you're not NIST-compliant. If you use AES, you're not GOST-compliant. For fuck's sake: stop using standardized crypto then.
        Do not build cipher cascades or I will hate you.

        .@grey_area NO you don't understand Americans and Belgians have a longstanding relationship that's why Belgian cipher won AES.
        If you designed your own custom SPN or your own hash core running in CTR mode I'd think more highly of you than if you built a cascade.
        Clinton's name isn't even mentioned for the first 5 minutes of this piece.
        A hacker group claiming responsibility for a DDoS, without any evidence even when asked, is just not good enough to include in an article.

        This post about Go random comes to exactly the wrong conclusion. Use crypto/rand. math/rand only if profile demands. https://appliedgo.net/random/ 
        crypto/rand is _way_ more expensive than math/rand, but rands rarely top profiles, and often end up being surprisingly security-relevant.
