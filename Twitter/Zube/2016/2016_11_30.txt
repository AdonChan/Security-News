        Silver Lining Dept: "Nine Hurt In Ohio State Attack; Football Team Safe." Actual ESPN headline. The playoffs are saved!
        Once Trump takes the oath, liberals will finally oppose those measures set down by Bush and expanded by Obama. Or they'll invade Russia.
        Yahoo News Headline: Neil Young wants Obama to end "violence" at pipeline protest. #standingrock
        Quotation marks suggest that state violence against the #StandingRock protesters is a matter of perspective, a subjective opinion at best.
        Were the violence going in the opposite direction, you can bet that Yahoo (and other news sites) wouldn't mince punctuation. #StandingRock
        This is happening under a president beloved by most liberals, a president who is expanding the war state before handing it over to Trump.
        Yet many online libs I've seen are ranting about Putin and Bernie. Had Hillary won, I wonder if #StandingRock would matter to them at all.
        Trump threatening to prosecute flag burners (all 12 of them) recalls Hillary Clinton's '05 Senate bill to do the same. She lost that, too.
        Now that Trump's after flag desecrators, I hope that Spank has changed his name and lives a quiet life.http://bit.ly/2gtFANi

        Block devices are buffered, so if one block is bad, the entire buffer is marked bad. Raw devs are not; if you set bs=512, can image more.
        Ex. if you read bs=512 from /dev/sdd, a bad block and 4k of other blocks get marked bad. Map to /dev/raw/, bs=512 can read all but one bad.

        Petraeus didn't have an email server, which is all that matters.

        It occurs to me that if you lost citizenship for flag burning, the main flag burners would be rich expats trying to avoid US taxes.

        The idea that people are unhappy is 'puzzling' is just another variant of the #notmyfaulter ideology that has taken hold.
