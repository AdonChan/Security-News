        .. evident truths (that are taboo to discuss) into his melange of lies / half-truths; his complaints about US manufacturing having been ..
        .. hollowed out and many working-class people not having seen significant pay rises in decades are all true. The losers of the ..
        .. economic changes of the last 15 years are not going to vote for an 'establishment' Republican, and neither for a 'establisment' Democrat.
        As the economic changes (and growth in inequality as well as shrinking of the middle class) continue, the voting base for someone like ..
        .. Trump will only grow. So brace yourself, world - even if Trump does not win this election, the long-term trends are in favor of him.

        Bracing for a day of being told that a horrible shooting had nothing to do with guns.
        Nobody likes to hear this but. These shooters are often motivated by posthumous infamy. Media coverage matters.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/opinion/the-virginia-shooter-wanted-fame-lets-not-give-it-to-him.html ...

        For instance, lots of economists say that we've done trade wrong. We need more social welfare for the losers.
        The key isn't support for welfare, it's support for small property and labor. For independent businesses, labor orgs, small farms, etc.
        Yet Alfred Kahn, not an unimportant guy, used to laugh about how it would be awesome to get rid of Teamsters.
        Today you see from all the sadness about how of course we have to build self-driving trucks and how trade losses are inevitable.
        And all the UBI proponents, many of whom proudly display their various work affiliations on Twitter.
        The history of this is clear. It was the first giant suburban college meritocratic generation that built the modern Dem ideology.
        This ideology sees the need for welfare spending for non-winners in a meritocratic winner take all economy.
        The populist view is that a financier meritocratic dominated structure is itself immoral and un American.
        And if you want a clear example of hatred, this rant by a liberal professor went viral on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153945516451677&id=359134596676 ... 
        Finally, I should say welfare spending itself is generally useful. We should have more of it, with fewer strings.
        But the essence of the problem is ideological. We must stop seeing people as poor and start seeing them as unfree.
        We must likewise recognize that all of us are being stripped of rights by elites. Commercial, political, economic rights.
        If a bank can foreclosure on you without showing the court it has that right, you are unfree.
        If someone can ship your job to China because Walmart wants it so, you are unfree.
        If you have no grievance procedure or can be fired just because your boss is a jerk, and it's not a full employment world, you are unfree.
        If American Airlines chooses to end the flights to your city, thus gradually strangling your community, you are unfree.
        Finally, for @Atrios, government's role is to ensure that we are a free people. Providing services is second-order.
        Also, and this is significant as it is obvious, millions in jail or threatened with jail are by definition unfree.
        This series of tweets by @matthewstoller is interesting. Not sure I agree with it all, but go read his timeline.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/741982387878273024 ... 
        And if you read the @matthewstoller timeline I mentioned, worth reading this series by @Chris_arnade.https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/741832871552389120 ...

        Things I would like the mainstream media to look at harder: 1) Donald Trump's ties to the mafiahttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910 ... 
        2) Donald Trump's history of using bribery to get government to do his bidding.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430266/donald-trump-bribery-politicians-hillary-clinton-robert-menendez-solomon-melgen ... 
        3) Trump's record of hiring illegal immigrantshttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-donald-trump-had-pay-1-million-hi/ ... 
        4) Donald Trump's tax evasion.
        5) the mysterious death of three Trump casino executives in a helicopter crash where the rotors "broke off" in clear weather
        Okay, the last one is sorta tenuous...like blaming Vince Foster's death on Trump (or Clinton).
        I could come up with a similar list for Hillary, but it seems we're already hitting that 24/7.
        Of course, I would settle for just a deep look at Trump's relationship with Roy Cohn. Because that would be enough.
        Especially the part where he cut off with Cohn when he learned Cohn had AIDS.
