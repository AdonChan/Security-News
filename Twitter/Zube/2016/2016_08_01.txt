        Somehow I feel that this is the best setting for the Hillary/Trump debates.pic.twitter.com/fzR3WS8mAn
        Some liberals say that if Sanders were the nominee, Trump would Red bait him. They should know since they did and are doing that very thing.
        Dem Red baiting goes back to Wilson (who did more than bait), but Truman was perhaps its finest practitioner, instituting loyalty oaths.
        Hillary's not as skilled as Truman, but she and her followers are giving it a pretty decent go.

        @thegrugq Java and Go both have great library ecosystems based on native and nearly entirely memory safe code rather than C libraries.
        @thegrugq Both have painfully restricted (due to precise garbage collection) and slow FFI support, which ends up being great for security.
        One reason we use Golang in SGOS because most libs written in pure Go, unlike Python etc which wrap insecure C libs.https://twitter.com/copperheados/status/759417993835061249 ... 
        Argh some C compilers include . by default when pre-processing and some don't. And some change their mind between versions. Argh argh argh.

        Its easy for progressives to organize opposition to bad Trump policies, but hard for them to organize opposition when Dems push bad policies
        This is a truism Dem presidents rely on when they triangulatehttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/759747546122039296 ... 
        Operative term here is "called for" - classic Dem rhetoric/promise vs reality http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121606200.html ... https://twitter.com/neeratanden/status/759749281968431104 ... 
        I remember Obama "calling for" NAFTA reform and new taxes...then I remember him pushing TPP and extending the Bush tax cuts.
        If Dems win in 2016, screams of "but Trump!" won't be as great at hiding the gap between their rhetoric and their policies.
        Then again, in this scenario, Dems will have the power to do whatever they want, and not care.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/759752239560859650 ...

        Clinton's favorability now 45/51, compared to 39/54 pre-convention. Trump's is 36/58, compared to 35/58 before:http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/07/clinton-image-improves-following-conventions-leads-trump-by-5.html ... 
        One thing that's interesting about this election is age. It's unusual to have a younger President handing back power to an older generation.
        Whoever wins, the next President will be at least 10 years older than the current one.
        The handing power to the new generation is pretty common and actually inevitable. The opposite is a bit unusual, no?
        One structural problem for Trump of lying so routinely is that it makes it virtually impossible to have good surrogates.
        Surrogates basically have to repeat/defend themes and ideas that ultimately come from the candidate. But there is no consistency from Trump.
        Both candidates grew up in the 1950s. Such a different perspective. Like growing up in a different culture than today's youth.

        Very big (n= 15,000) study on sex differences in IQ finds not only no mean difference,but no difference in variance.
        So, here's a horrifying notion:
        Because networking is so cheap, and wifi is so very convenient, someone'll hook an arduino or summat to some explosive.
        And worse, they'll doubtlessly home-roll their control measures - so it'll be nasty, buggy software connecting the internet and an explosion
        Worse - far far worse? 
        @munin imagine this. A port-scanner hits it. It hard-reboots. Reboot brings all the GPIOs into the default pull-up state...
        @munin but really explosion is by far not the worst thing that can happen. like imagine a tank of methyl isocyanate instead

        Boarded flight 3/3 and ran out of luck. Bad weather, delayed out of Newark by +/- 1 hour. Oh well. QC25 and iPad.
        ETA McCarran 7:58PM. That's a 3hr delay from original schedule. Oh well. #passwords16
