        Hillary Clinton consistently supported the fossil fuel industry, and shrouded that support in the argot of pragmatic progressivism (1/x)
        Trump poses an even more dangerous form of climate change threat than Clinton, because he has at times denied it is even real (2/x)
        Silver lining with Trump could be that he makes it easier for the climate change movement to organize, because he's not a Democrat (3/x)
        Clinton (like Obama) prolly woulda kept pushing policy making the climate situation worse, but in a Dem way that anesthetized the left (4/x)
        Doesnt at all mean Trump is better for the cause of stopping climate change. Just means he creates opportunities that Clinton wouldnt (5/5)
        If you're a Trump supporter, I'd like to hear from you what you think good accountability journalism looks like in covering the new admin.

        1 Voting systems really do have exploitable vulnerabilities
        I apologize for holding nuanced views on  this.
        @mattblaze An audit won't really tell us if machines were hacked. It will only show if there were discrepancies between paper/digital votes.
        Also worth pointing out that a "recount" under state law may not be an "audit" sufficient for this purpose.
