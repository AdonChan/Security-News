SwiftOnSecurity

        @SwiftOnSecurity oh my god I remember that. holy fuck that shit was horrifying
        Don't even get me started on forum software in the early-2000's, where any hacker had a privesc on gaming forums because they sucked so hard
        I remember a forum in ~2003, a hacker named "Viper" would visit and screw with the admins for fun every few weeks. Nothing they could do.
        90s-early 2000s web was truly a wild west where crackers of any level really reigned unchecked. There were no valid assumptions of safety.
        This past inability to trust platforms and their integrity, at any level, continues to significantly poison the modern rhetoric and focus.
        Modern security practitioners should start by designing logical controls using existing tools, not first obsessing over them being pointless
        @SwiftOnSecurity http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/07/24/msn_bug_serves_up_porn/ ... 
        @SwiftOnSecurity I ruined a few forums when I was 12. So easy to get admin passwords or put unfiltered HTML in your username
        I've said this 100 times, but starting off I was worried about Chinese 0days - when we still didn't even patch our Windows XP SP2 clients.
        @SwiftOnSecurity Never Forget.pic.twitter.com/wxnIow1rFm
        Hey, remember putting HTML redirects in your forum signature?
        Oh god, remember, you could put <script> in your forum signature.
        @co60ca @SwiftOnSecurity 4chan didn't start stripping EXIF data until ~2014.pic.twitter.com/N49QQ2OyCp
        @SwiftOnSecurity I remember setting my profile picture as the logout URL. :)
        User I didn't like hotlinked in their forum signature an image from my server. Changed the image, reported them, were banned.
        In my defense, I think the mod totally recognized image was from my server, but the user really was a jerk and they just went with it. lol
        @SwiftOnSecurity i found this on imageshack back in 2008 http://news.softpedia.com/news/ImageShack-Flaw-Exposes-IP-Address-of-Uploaders-94437.shtml ...  amazing how common stuff like this still is.

        Any Russian nuclear strategy doesn't have to make sense to its targets, only its authors.
        A second hard truth is that in the West, we care more about Russian intention than we do strategy or capability.
        I'd like to point out this also applies to non-nuclear strategies (am assuming this is not obvious to some).https://twitter.com/thedexterclaw/status/813785839868268544 ...

        So the irony: buying the AppleTV for the winner in UK at Apple triggered the credit card block. But only after that one had been authorized.
        Also funny was that the lady told me card was blocked because it was used with company known to be not careful with credit card data: 
        Are the #33c3 streams already up?
        Okay streams are there but the AppleTV app doesn't see them (yet).
        Visit https://streaming.media.ccc.de/  for #33c3 streams. Most talks will be available later on https://media.ccc.de/
