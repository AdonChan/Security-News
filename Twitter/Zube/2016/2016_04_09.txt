        Under proposed legislation, you must help government make content readable. 
        Note the proposed encryption legislation is worded to force Apple to recover your data even if you wipe your phone, which destroys keys.
        Proposed legislation insists you don't have to redesign your product, but to comply, Apple would need to do exactly that.

        Gee--the Burr-Feinstein bill speaks of products "controlled" or "provided" by covered entities.  Does that include stuff in the app store?
        @SteveBellovin It seems to go out of its way to include that - talks about license providers.
        @SteveBellovin 3(c) reads like it requires app stores to mandate backdoored apps. What about Amazon selling boxed software?
        For most software developers, the bill basically makes including crypto too much trouble. Crypto becomes an expensive & insecure feature.
        I've just picked up a rumor that this version of Burr-Feinstein may be an old version of the bill.

        If you suffer from low blood pressure, here's the Feinstein-Burr key escrow bill: https://www.scribd.com/doc/307378123/Burr-Encryption-Bill-Discussion-Draft ... 
        I could spend all night listing the various ways that Feinstein-Burr is flawed & dangerous. But let's just say, "in every way possible."
        Things that AREN'T wrong with the Feinstein-Burr crypto bill:
        OK, that's not entirely fair. Spelling and grammar are acceptable.
        They've actually come up with something worse than Clipper.
        Was there ANY actual technical input into this bill?
        This should be called the "Computer Crime Encouragement Act of 2016"
        Impossible to cover the dangers of the Feinstein-Burr bill in 140 chars. Instead, see our Keys Under Doormats paper. http://cybersecurity.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/17/cybsec.tyv009.abstract ... 
        Feinstein-Burr will result in two different kinds of crypto in the US:
        For most software developers, the bill basically makes including crypto too much trouble. Crypto becomes an expensive & insecure feature.
        The @WhiteHouse has said it won't oppose the Burr-Feinstein backdoor bill. That's absolutely absurd. https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160408/08381934131/burr-feinstein-release-their-anti-encryption-bill-more-ridiculous-than-expected.shtml ... 
        Where did the Feinstein-Burr bill text posted to scribd last night come from? Was that a leak or an official post? Is it a current draft?
        @ericgeller @mattblaze @Cory_Bennett as part of this story that would love your clicks http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/275567-senate-intel-encryption-bill-mandates-technical-assistance ...

        Philly folks: there's a sportsing-related parade on Market St. toward City Hall right now. If that's not where you want to be, stay away.

        .@paulkrugman said in latest piece Lehman "wasn't necessarily that big." Excuse me? 
        1/As someone who worked across from the Lehman building for many years, I cannot begin to explain how central of a Wall St player they were
        2/ Nor how stunning & shocking was their fall. No one could believe Hank Paulson let them fail. Everyone lost their goddamn mind.
        3/ I was at Merrill Lynch at the time (no longer across the street from Lehman). We were quickly bought by BAC. Ppl feared nationalization
        4/anyone who tries to understate that failure of Lehman by saying it was small is punking you.

        The BBC is describing Cameron's £9m EU leaflet as having 14 pages. Normally a leaflet's pages would be a multiple of four. #leafletchat
        "I'll defend this leaflet until I'm red in the face. Okay, I can stop now."pic.twitter.com/BBXK1yDFbi
        The government's website says the leaflet is 16 pages. The BBC should close down immediately in shame. #leafletchatpic.twitter.com/tXvcGfHmm5
        I have complained to the BBC about their "14 page" leaflet error. I expect someone will lose their job over it, and I'm glad. #leafletchat
        If the government had given me the £9m I could have just given a non-committal shrug and everyone would have been happy.
        My instinct at this point, were I JJ Abrams, would be to remake the original Star Wars trilogy with an all female cast.
        I mean, I'm not against women or anything, but having a female lead in a Star Wars film IS LIKE HAVING AN ATOMIC DONKEY SHIT IN MY MOUTH.
        Getting the truth out of David Cameron is like getting blood out of a spam-faced pig fucking stone.
        Jeremy Corbyn watches as David Cameron is caught in a situation that cost Iceland's prime minister his job. Time passes. Nothing happens.
        We're all in this together; we're all out this together; in, out, offshore account; that's what it's all about.
        You cock farting shit cunt. #CurseDavidCameron
        What's the plan for getting rid of Dave, then? Online petition? A meme? Personally, I'm planning to tweet something sarcastic to him later.
        The slogan for the Ditch Dave campaign should be "Get To Fuck".
        I like to think Cameron is heading down to the bunker now with a loaded pistol, but in reality he's probably eating a poached duck egg.
        I will be celebrating the Grand National tomorrow by going out and kneecapping a horse.

        Bill Clinton loses his mind when challenged from the left. If #BlackLivesMatter protestors had been right-wing, he'd have been conciliatory.

        6. If ppl, say, attacked the 1994 Act for funding police instead of public defenders, then maybe protests wld fix TODAY'S issues.
        7A. But again, the biggest risk: arguing that the 1994 Act caused #MassIncarceration suggests the feds can fix it today.
        7B. Ending #MassIncarceration is a state-by-state, county-by-county battle. Fighting crime is too. That's where attention must be focused.
        Kids today don't remember Bill Clinton interrupted a campaign just so he could fly back to Arkansas to sign a death warrant on camera.
        There is no online community pathology that Wikipedia hasn't already carefully studied and explored.
        You don't have to agree with how they handle it, but if your community has a pathology and you haven't even LOOKED at how WP handled it...

        Only Bill Clinton could triangulate an apology!https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/718459179539816451 ... 
        "If you're a BLM protester who votes in NY ... I'm sort of sorry. If you're a white working class voter who liked my remarks - I'm not!"
        Happy for the (badly needed, in my case) reminder that Bill Clinton is fucking insufferable.
        So this is pretty funny. https://medium.com/frog-and-toad-are-cofounders/the-lost-engineer-727bd2a221ef#.z7sd8ni5g ... 
        I've just picked up a rumor that this version of Burr-Feinstein may be an old version of the bill.
        There is no variant of the Burr-Feinstein bill that could possibly address San Bernardino that is going to be OK.
        But also, having said that: I'll gladly put money against any such bill ever passing.
        Oh FFS you can check if a Golang big/Int is zero with Sign()? Why is there no IsZero()?
        Having never written a backdoor in software, I'm guessing you don't start by saying "if $do_backdoor { //insert evil here}"
