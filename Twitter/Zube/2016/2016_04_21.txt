        First round of blackhat talks announced.  I'll be interested to see this one: https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices ...  since its a CAN traffic tool.
        As a "professional" car hacker, I don't need a tool beyond Vehicle Spy and the ecomcat we released.  But I'm ready to see what I'm missing!
        A lot of people seem to build CAN tools, but really it is a simple protocol, don't need to do much.  Maybe because Vehicle Spy costs money?
        ...and I guess you need an ecom cable for ecomcat, which is $179. But you're car hacking a car, seems like a small investment in comparison.
        I'll be curious to see what they come up with as I've been doing tons of CAN stuff lately.  See if they could have made my life easier.
        for me personally, right now, tooling is not the limiting factor for me (unless you mean embedded ECU debuggers or something which I need!)

        Getting a warrant for recent or current activity pertaining to a crime is very different from getting a warrant for a person's entire life.
        This is what our court system is doing: Treating warrants for "pot" as a warrant for an entire person's intimate life, charging more crimes.

        This is a good precedent. Let's replace the rest of the presidents too, and add MLK, Rosa Parks, and others standing up for civil rights.

        Hamilton should probably be moved to the $100 bill or to a new higher denomination bill that ordinary people use very rarely.
        Shouldn't Jackson fans be happy that he is no longer going to be identified with the sort of central banking he warred against?
        As much as I dislike him, Hamilton should be on a dollar denomination. He created the dollar. The anomaly is Ben Franklin.
