        Our blackhat talk on CAN bus injection is pretty cool yet got rejected by defcon.  There are 3 other can bus talks at defcon this year.
        I'm excited to see those talks and see what they're all about.  I'm expecting great things!

        The big companies you valorize, who you imagine have security under control, they've got people just like you trying to hold it together.
        The myth that 'Everyone Else Does Security Better' is SO TOXIC. You'll end up thinking you're uniquely terrible. I sure did. For YEARS.
        For years I read how everyone was awesome at security, how if I didn't do X and Y and buy Z I was criminally incompetent. I believed it.
        Anyway, that's how I ended up crying in my car in the company parking lot a few times.

        Good jorb!
        When your code driven smart contract is dependent on the whims of a vote by unelected parties you've got bigger problems than an epic vuln.
        .@Allan_Wirth Maybe I'm missing something, but Etherium feels like a bad implantation of a clever idea to solve a problem nobody has.
        Q: What is The DAO?
        So...out of curiosity, are these Etherium 'smart contracts' I keep hearing about written in a turing-completely language?

        Perhaps "smart contracts" are, in fact, "dumb contracts":https://twitter.com/halvarflake/status/743920587672805377 ... 
        It's my considered opinion that the exploit on the Etherium 'DAO' is fair play. 
        Just think of it as a very, very expensive bug bounty and count yourselves lucky it was found now as opposed to later ;-)
        And in the future, designate your contracts as finite state machines that are provably not turing complete.
        Perhaps take a look at Langsec for how to build such grammars ;-)
