        "Why can't Apple just keep a backdoor private, like the Coke recipe?" Now swap backdoor for data, and Apple for OPM, Amex, Target, etc.
        The "Coke recipe" argument also falls apart in that there are plenty of people who reverse engineered Coke and put the recipe on the web.
        @JZdziarski and let's not forget in 2006 someone inside ripped off the recipe and tried to sell it to Pepsi.

        For 20 years the carriers circled the Pacific. Humanity heard nothing from its creation, save coded demands for maintenance material barges.
        Then, a message, broadcast worldwide. "Prepare for me in Virgina." A carrier broke off and headed towards the eastern seaboard.
        After 20 years it was time to refuel the reactors. A drydock was prepared. The ship approached. The world watched, and held its breath.
        CVN-X drifted into the lock, winched by rope attached with loops fired by cannon. It was green with algae, paint bleach white like a ghost.
        The carrier's drones fired in salvos, taking flight into the air. Soldiers brought their weapons to bear, but were told to hold fire.
        Helicopters circled, the world's vantage on their lost ship broadcast to every eye as fast as light sped. The shoremen prepared to board.
        In the commotion, nobody noticed the jet elevator lifting to the deck. But they soon did. Television cameras shot in, focus searching.

        to extract pictures (losslessly) from a PDF, better rely on PDFImages (from poppler-utils).
        FTR PDF doesn't handle image transparency, so transparent PNGs will be stored (and re-exracted) as an image and a transparency mask.

        I just proposed a fix for #PaX #ASLR on @NetBSD 32-bits emulation (PR kern/50469) http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-bugs/2016/03/20/msg045460.html ...  (insert baby-dancing GIF here)
        Now @nmap can check #SQLServer for SSL/TLS issues. I found POODLE, self-signed MD5 certs. What will you find? https://twitter.com/digininja/status/710867357917380608 ...

        How is it that "serious" news publications are dignifying the Megyn Kelly / Trump feud? It's pro-wrestling. She's the face, he's the heel.
        Wait for the exciting twist, when the heel becomes the hero. Maybe Kelly and Trump will reverse roles...  exciting!
        Or maybe they'll team up against a worse adversary, like the evil Hillary Clinton, a foe so terrible they'll be forced to bury the hatchet.
        These are reality TV tropes, and reality TV stole them from the 1980s WWF.

        This problem is, so far as I can tell, the *only* current use case for DNSSEC/DANE, and if STS works, it will obsolete that use case.
        So, @_mattjoseph is worth paying attention to today.

        Nobody knows how to "program" DNA. They just copy-and-paste bits from other organisms. A bit like how most code is built from stackoverflow.
