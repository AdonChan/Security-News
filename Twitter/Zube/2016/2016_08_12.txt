        If you're running Linux under Secure Boot, you can protect yourself against the Microsoft vulnerability by removing the Windows signing key
        Linux distributions are signed with the third party signing key, so will continue booting even if you remove the Windows signing key
        Ok I can definitely run self-signed boot code using the Windows 8 bootmgfw.efi so that's a thing

        Anti-virus folks are going to be really really unhappy when malware authors start using SGX, or if someone hacks an SGX application.

        Also think of how many, many PhDs and papers will be written on side-channel attacks to extract private & symmetric keys from SGX programs.
        Interesting applications for card processors tho. Process all card payments in an SGX program so even malware on the device can't steal it.
        Your files have all been encrypted, and the key to decrypt them is stored in SGX. To get your files, send 0.5 BTC to address asdpoiuy1j23129
        Can the FBI get an All-Writs-Act order to make Intel decrypt an SGX binary? Asking for a friend.

        Not sure, but I think if cannabis is rescheduled to Schedule III -- as some think may happen -- every MD in US can prescribe off-label.
        Compare to status quo in Illinois, for instance, where medical cannabis law has a predefined list of qualifying conditions.
        At Schedule III, prescriptions can have up to 5 automatic refills; can be prescribed indefinitely (w/ renewed scripts).
        Point being: if DEA reschedules cannabis to Schedule III, they'll federally legalize medical marijuana with no qualifying condition limits.
