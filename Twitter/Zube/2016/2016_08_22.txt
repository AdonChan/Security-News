        One lesson of @nudehaberdasher and I releasing full details of some pretty scary attacks is that its okay to do so.
        Many in academia are still afraid to do this.  It is important to learn and be able to reproduce results, people!

        SIP hasn't been around for too long, and still has holes. I wouldn't trust it alone to save you, nor see a problem turning it off for 5 min.

        People are like: if only those NSA 0days had been fixed long time ago our CISCO (whatever) gear would be safe!!!
        In case my sarcasm was not clear: when the NSA 0day is fixed (they or) someone else will have different 0day.
        Every time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection. They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up!

        Least (& yet most) interesting question about NSA TAO tools: why were those firewalls vulnerable in the first place? Because software.
        Want to learn to write code that contains secret backdoors that can be exploited by intelligence agencies? Take a programming class. Done.
        Want to learn to write code that doesn't? Well, harder.
        There's a backdoor in the C complier, which is that it produces executable code.
        Confession: I write code in C. But at this point, I'm harboring that as a dangerous eccentricity, like driving a classic car w/o seat belts.
