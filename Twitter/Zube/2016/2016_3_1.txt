        So the vulnerability is out and known before the patch. Yay! #openssl  https://twitter.com/deeks/status/704054290277658624 ... 

        Does anyone else think it's a stupid idea to have public commits for a 'secret security vulnerability to be disclosed in X days'?
        Who the hell thought of that.
        This is why we can't have nice things.
        Good night everyone: nice to know there's recent exploit code that will take days to patch.
        @mattiasgeniar seems like LibreSSL is not vulnerable. They threw out the vulnerable code long ago http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/src/crypto/bio/b_print.c.diff?r1=1.23&r2=1.21 ...

        It's Oscar night, the one night of the year people named Oscar are allowed out in public.
        "It's a great night to be white!" simpers noted actress Jill Buffoon on the red carpet. #oscars2016

        White people win statuette of small white man, who has been painted gold for diversity.
        "Donald Trump, will you denounce the KKK?" "No, I think it's a great place to buy fried chicken."
        I'm delighted that Leonardo DiCaprio has won an Oscar. After the terrible life he's had as a film star it must ease his existential pain.
        But when will Shit the Beef win a little gold man for his sterling work in 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'?
        The BBC News website's top story right now is "DiCaprio finally wins first Oscar". Second story: Humans dismantle shelters of other humans.
        "DiCaprio Finally wins Oscar". Finally. FINALLY. Like one of humanity's great injustices has been rectified.
        The sum of all human endeavour has culminated in the awarding of an Oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio. There is nowhere left for us to go.
        Still finally can't believe finally that finally Leonard DiCaprio has finally won an Oscar finally at last.
        "We're being tear-gassed, we are desperate," a Syrian migrant in Greece said, adding, "Still, great news about DiCaprio getting the Oscar."
