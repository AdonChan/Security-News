        Idea for new VDSO feature: a function to query whether there are tasks waiting to run on the current cpu.
        Proposed usage case is mutexes deciding whether to spin for a while or immediately futex_wait.
        If there are tasks waiting, spinning for a mutex is wasting cpu time during which something else could be running.
        Alternate idea with different abstraction: VDSO version of futex_wait that spins in userspace iff kernel thinks that's appropriate.

        This seems to be a common thread with popular AR games, especially amongst AR novices.

        Is someone deliberately feeding Leadsom bad advice for laughs or is she just a shit?
        Don't forget that, policy-wise, May is just as appalling as Leadsom.
        I hope Andrea Leadsom is so completely off her rocker with dismay at not becoming prime minister that she finds a way to force an election.
