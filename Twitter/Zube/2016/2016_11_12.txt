        We have a moral responsibility in the tech community to protect people from the surveillance apparatus we've built around them. It's urgent
        If you work in tech, your company needs to be making contingency plans for how to protect personal data in very adversarial circumstances
        We are lucky that the American electoral system gives us two months before a transition of power. We need to use every day of it wisely
        Many people in tech feel helpless. Channel these feelings into productive action, and make your voice heard in companies that hoard data
        Nerds, remember how in "Seveneves" there's a week or so before everyone realizes the clock is ticking? We need a similar sense of focus
        @Pinboard Buy my 60-Day Civic Fitness Plan DVD.
        Have a plan for when the nice men with full legal authority, or the not so nice men without it, come to put the machine in your data center
        Right now I know Google, Apple, Facebook are doing nothing meaningful to prepare for an unprecedented series of threats to their users
        I also know that engineers and security teams in those companies are very concerned, and given a chance would be able to do vital work
        Behavioral data: Don't collect it. 
        @Pinboard what if we just jump to the bit we're it goes "5000 years later"?
        All cats--calico, tuxedo, doesn't matter--will be anonymized. RT @FourOctets: @Pinboard what's your plan to protect our meme links?
        Few tech companies have seriously planned for a situation where our own government could be a threat to users. Lots of work and little time

        If they're serious about seceding, Trump's first policy crisis could be a civil war with the west coast.
        And now people are earnestly telling me all about how it's not legal for states to secede.
        Looks like sometime during that 9 hour period, the staff got the phone back from him.
        If you think this election gives you license to harass or abuse, or encourage others to do so, yes, "deplorable" is exactly what you are.

        anyway, the clinton and clintonite era should be over. collectively they had many bites at the apple. move on
        eventually your time passes. not age, or even failure, just time. it's over.
        The Democratic Party has to be focused on grassroots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties.
        Private sector runs so much better than government b/c you have accountable *dictators* running the show.  Called "CEOs."
        Elite, highly-educated, cream of the crop superstars. Given power to chart whatever course they want. And held accountable to the results.

        "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."
        7. There's been so much elite-liberal investment in idea that disagreement on social issues is always bigoted that it's hard to walk back.
        Someone asked me what charisma is. A big part of it is seeming to care a lot about whoever you're talking to.
        People who've met Bill Clinton all say the same thing: when he talks to you, you feel like you're the center of the world.
        The seeming to care need not be fake; indeed, the best way of seeming to care about people is actually to care about them.
