        . @flyryan we didn't use any private framework like all the battery monitor tools in the store that speak IOKIT.
        . @flyryan we call some systemcall directly like hundreds of other apps do. But systemcalls are not private API.
        Apple claiming syscall() is private API ...pic.twitter.com/3jMwDAOXdK
        As I said before our app is doing nothing you will not find in 1000 other iOS apps...
        . @0xjared it is a question how you define private API. IMHO you cannot claim that function in libc header files is private.
        . @chmod007 you mean SYS_csops from /sys/syscall.h in iOS SDK is private?
        They are now telling me the function is not private but the syscall numbers are *g*https://twitter.com/0xjared/status/730860629590999040 ... 
        What sense does it make to declare the syscall() function as iOS allowed in the iOS SDK / then claim syscall numbers are private
        Not funnyhttps://twitter.com/rgov/status/730862383476805632 ... 
        IOKit for the win ... Some app I bought from AppStorepic.twitter.com/QemvGEk4pu
        Btw if sysctl and syscall are forbidden function for the AppStore I wonder why 1st review did not spot those functions in our binding table?
        . @rasmusvuori no the point here is that it is an app with only one feature: show battery stats via private API.
        Another IOKit using battery info tool. Where is the Apple private API police?https://twitter.com/germanstudent/status/730874853172121600 ... 
        . @msolnik isn't the bigger question: how does the automatic AppStore review process miss forbidden functions in lazy_bind table?
        . @msolnik I thought it is the line of defense against malware. How does it miss imported functions?
        . @msolnik yeah the answer is: they are not forbidden
        . @msolnik well I want to see the outcry of Apple forbidding sysctl()
        . @msolnik well csops() doesn't even have MAC hooks. So obviously it is not considered sensitive...
        Hey @fouseyTUBE get this iPhone security info app before Apple kills it from the storehttps://appsto.re/de/TmEAab.i 
        On Monday I will show a feature that we deliberately left out of the app because it really requires a private API.
        Apparently that documentary series CSI:Cyber is being canceled
        Guess what... Next day and our app is still kept deliberately in Apple review limbo.
