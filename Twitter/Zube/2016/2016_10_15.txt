        As Trump circles the drain and liberals veer from gloating to self-induced panic, I pulled from my files M.O'Donoghue's THE LIBERAL BOOK.
        Written in 1965-66 (with periodic updates), it's simply a long list of liberal beliefs. Though dated in spots, much of it could apply today.
        LIBERALS approve of premarital intercourse. In fact, they call it that.
        LIBERALS are convinced that the solution to police brutality is to pay them more.
        LIBERAL parents encourage their children to call them by their first name.
        LIBERALS own Siamese cats with clever names usually drawn from mythology.
        LIBERALS drive Volkswagens, particularly if they are Jewish.
        LIBERALS write articles like: "The Case for Seat Belts on Our Subways"
        "Is the Afro-American Satisfied with His Television Image?"
        LIBERALS say: "I agree with their goals but not their tactics!"
        LIBERALS say:

        GOP has been conning its base for so long. Naturally, the final act in the con is to blame disappointments on a banker/media conspiracy (1)
        How abt policies that might actually benefit GOP base instead of nihilistic pandering? Wouldn't it be easier than conspiracy-mongering? (2)
        That said, if the Dem wing thinks elite failure and 1% parasitism is an exclusively GOP problem, they are dangerously deluded. (3)
        Next election cycle: "Did you support @realDonaldTrump?" will be the new "Did you support the war in Iraq?"

        Airlines have a tried-and-true method to raise fares. You'll see it this winter. http://bloom.bg/2enLwKI  via @business
        Bloomberg: The Cheap Airfare Party Is About to End
        Basically this story is about how airlines are colluding on prices, only without mentioning antitrust or collusion.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-14/the-cheap-airfare-party-is-about-to-end ... 
        Wall Street analyst: "Delta's choice of a slow-growth 2017 will 'turn up the heat on American and United to demonstrate similar conviction'"
        Wall Street analysts are explicit that the business model in a concentrated airline industry is colluding to raise prices.
        What I don't understand is how the story by @justinbachman doesn't mention @JustinElliott's.https://www.propublica.org/article/airline-consolidation-democratic-lobbying-antitrust ... 
        In other words, after a bevy of illegal mergers, airlines are now cutting capacity and raising prices.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-14/the-cheap-airfare-party-is-about-to-end ... 
        And yes, they were illegal. The Clayton Act is clear, mergers that "substantially lesson competition" are illegal. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/18 ...

        This Yellen speech is really worth a read http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20161014a.htm ... 
        This Yellen speech is an acknowledgment that a good chunk of our financial macro-economics is wrong http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20161014a.htm ...  (h/t @M_C_Klein)
        In bureaucratic jargon, Yellen notes that inequality, poverty, and debt can break the Fed's tools (aka the monetary transmission channel).
        Yellen is saying that if you can't get a small biz loan or your credit card has a 30% interest rate, the Fed lowering rates doesn't matter.pic.twitter.com/M0vrM5WV4T
        If your debt load on your house is upside down or if banks won't lend, then the Fed lowering rates doesn't matter.
        What is frustrating is that experts have known about this problem for years. They were just ignored by the economics establishment.

        But so far, I call a saving of almost $600/year a good investment of my time (couple of evenings hacking on scripts).
        And that's assuming the $50/month plan would stay the same, at the current growth it would likely cost me a lot more.

        Mass, undifferentiated leaks of merely internal conversations are sugar crumbs leading away from focused or powerful, dissident politics.
        Indiscriminate destruction of privacy, blurring of lines between corruption & gossip/internal conversation won't bring challenge to power.
        Holding the powerful accountable isn't letting hackers (with own agendas) curate sugary crumbs of gossip for you. It's exposing corruption.
        I'm talking about the ecological effect of wanton destruction of privacy on the ability to dissent. Not whether any one email is newsworthy.
        Counter to the internet isn't censorship, it's misinformation & information glut. Counter to dissident politics is destruction of privacy.
        Personal privacy and non-public conversations aren't conspiracies. Power is what should be made more transparent.https://twitter.com/kragen/status/786269762179346432 ... 
        If it was "coming soon" in 1988, it's time to refresh the display and say "these are from a future we abandoned, kids. Do better than us!"

        25: If you don't live badly, you feel good.
        Others may be reassured to hear Trump has only a 15% chance of winning, but it terrifies me. In Silicon Valley 15% is a good chance.
        The expected value calculation for Trump winning is the same as for a nuclear accident. Low probability x really bad = real worry.
