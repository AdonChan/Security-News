        Latest UGV standards provide for an autonomous capability module; support is already there for a robot to autonomously kill a suspect.
        Have found all kinds of great documentation on unmanned vehicle protocols and nothing mentioning the word "encryption" in any of them.
        In the future, the robot that kills you will:
        There's an entire protocol dance in AS5669 to turn on header compression on your robot, but not one word about encryption.
        As I understand, all encryption is done at the link layer; if you have an N:1 relationship with a control unit, link access = full control.

        In a way, it is depressing - the days where the computer you could place on your desk was within 50x of what a company could buy are over.
        And I am extremely thankful for FB's contribution to the Open Compute Project.
        Sometimes I wish I could on-demand rent servers guaranteed to be in the same rack and with fast interconnect, instead of mysto VMs.
        I want to rent a computer, but I'm offered pocket calculators simulated on a computer that I am supposed to use to simulate a computer. Wut?

        Lol the French team is leading because of a corrupt referee.
        Anyway the german team is clearly better than the French team so time enough to fix the unfair referee decisions

        Too bad... Bad luck and a biased referee... Goodbye #EuRO2016
        Bad bad luck and at least 2 not given penalty kicks in the first half. Goodbye #EURO2016
        @i0n1c @Zaister das die Uefa auch einen Italienischen Schiri ins Spiel schickt, nach den Viertelfinale :(
        Exactly. Having an italian referee after we just thrown them out was not good.
        It should be forbidden in UEFA rules that referees coming from countries just kicked out are allowed to judge against the team who did it.
        @i0n1c germans took out italy , italian referee , what do you expect ?
        Search Twitter for "italian ref" right now 
        italy eliminated by germany, germany eliminated by an italian ref  #smh
        ....I still don't understand why they had an Italian ref either. The bias was very noticeable.
        so since they put up an italian ref for this game, shouldn't the final be officiated by a german ref? #EURO2016 i mean, its only fair!
        Great idea: lets have a german ref for the finals.

        Right now it feels as if the world has gone mad. Stay safe, everyone.
        Before you hit retweet tonight:
        I'd like to see fewer people on Twitter explaining how each unspeakable tragedy proves their talking points. It's okay to just be very sad.
        How was the control link to the Dallas bomb robot secured?  Stakes go *way* up when something like this is repurposed as a weapon.
        I've seen police robots controlled by cables, but also (analog, unsecured) wireless links.
        (I'm assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that the bomb delivery robot was an improvised arrangement, not something it was designed for.)
        Assuming this is the robot, appears to be wireless. (HT @elizabeth_joh)https://twitter.com/PopSci/status/751418925355831296 ... 

        Glad to be focused on the robot, because all the rest of the news of the last few days is too awful to think about right now.
        Is there any way to configure an Apple Airport for remote etherenet without also enabling it as a wireless extender?
        That is, I want the device to JOIN the wireless network (and provide access via wired ethernet), but not "EXTEND" the network.
        @mattblazehttps://twitter.com/asher_wolf/status/751426097179348992 ... 

        Thanks everyone: short answer: Airport EXPRESS can do this, EXTREME can't.
        Speculation: the "flashbang" reporters were warned about earlier in the morning might have been DPD testing their improvised robo-explosive.
        I can't imagine improvising something like that and deploying it without testing it first.

        Disarm most American police officers.
        Stop hiring assault officers. Start hiring unarmed compliance officers. Reduce assault force through attrition.
        Castile was pulled over for a tail light. Chicago tickets RED LIGHT RUNNERS  automatically, without pulling them over.
        In no sane system does a busted tail light -- a FIX IT TICKET -- need to be issued by someone carrying a HANDGUN.
        It's not impossible. The police force can be disarmed through attrition. Stop hiring assault officers. Replace w/ compliance officers.
        We're already automating most of traffic policing. Ostensibly: traffic stops among the most dangerous things officers do. Stop.
        I believe overwhelming majority of police are good, well-meaning, and in an impossible situation created by poor public policy.

        Oh, shit. A big company just deployed secure messaging to a shitload of users. Time to throw a temper tantrum.
        I was angry about having to learn RLWE but then I read the Bos/Costello RLWE paper and now I'm not angry anymore.
        well, wait, no, I'm still a super angry person, but i'm not angry about LWE.
        Compared to SIDH, RLWE seems pretty straightforward to me. Anything is better than isogenies.
