        When you talk about tampering with clear text across a network, you have to consider packet injection and eavesdropping as a common threat.
        If FBI's exploit was deployed across a Tor network, there is a reasonable likelihood of the exit node operator intercepting / reusing it.

        OH: "Full Account Access is the MewTwo of OAuth scopes."
        Oh, and this is a good reminder to audit your users' OAuth permissions. OAuth consent phishing is even easier than credential phishing.

        Someone asked us how to generate a PGP key when they have 3 endorsement for cryptography in @LinkedIn. Where is the best metric?
        @adulau Depending on how random the endorsements are, they may or may not provide you with enough entropy to generate a key pair.
