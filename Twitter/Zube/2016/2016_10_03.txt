        Then again, if he made $1B but didn't pay tax on it, and then later deducted a $1 billion loss...now that would be pretty notable...https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/782574368794681345 ... 
        Hear that? That's the sound of 5,000 underpaid reporters furiously aggregating the New York Times right now.
        I just checked my mailbox and unfortunately it's another day nobody magically sent me a giant scoop to write up. Sad!
        not to be this guy but the fact that what Trump did was even legal seems like the real outrage herepic.twitter.com/Hz0XLsbVaY
        Shorter version: we walked into work and the documents magically appeared in the mailhttps://twitter.com/amychozick/status/782578514549673985 ... 
        NYT did no work to get docs - it wasnt a Spotlight-esque tale of reporting. But NYT deserves big credit for publishing despite legal threat.
        Every journo is jealous of not being magically mailed such docs. But few news orgs would have NYT's guts to publishhttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/782587648154054657 ... 
        We're in that stage of the election in which tweeting "the sky is blue," "water is wet" or other truisms prompts embittered personal insults
        Worth mentioning that the NYT hasn't always shown such guts, but still glad they did what they did right now http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/16/AR2005121601716.html ... https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/782588924317175808 ... 
        Odd -- I don't remember the folks berating the NYT for publishing Trump docs also being mad about news orgs publishing hacked DNC emails.
        Alternate theory: they got the docs because they are the biggest news org in the worldhttps://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/782592951662829568 ... 
        Funniest part of Trump's legal threat against NYT is imagining a news org then being empowered to do discovery on him. That'd be delicious.
        How can Trump both be a great businessman and also a "genius" for losing $1 billion?http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-surrogates-spin-nyt-tax-story-proof-trumps/story?id=42497014 ...

        Out of curiosity, anyone seen that IoT botnet's sources running around somewhere? I want to build some IOCs.
        [I mean, the massive spike in traffic -should- be a clue, but.]
        This TCP DoS traffic in this bot is stupid -it sends from random source addresses.
        This bot shouldn't work on any network that's filtering traffic that doesn't come from its' address allocation.
        That's basic netadmin best practices - and res ISPs ought to already have that filtering in place. This DoS was entirely unnecessary.
        .@kyhwana And now I've got a really really good argument for strong egress filtering.
        .@kyhwana Ah, apparently the source IP can be user-defined!

        @munin not just any old spoofing either, RFC1918 IP emitters are commonplace.
        @ModusMundi @munin Go one step up the supply chain. A lot of IoT has default creds because dev kits they build on ship with default creds.
