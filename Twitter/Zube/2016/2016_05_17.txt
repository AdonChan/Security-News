        . @trifero it is very visible proof that Apple has not changed at all which some lemmings claim.
        Keep in mind one feature of the app was that you could verify two iPhones actually run the same binary and not one phone had a special one
        So if someone got physical access to you phone and pulled a @officialmcafee & gave you a backdoored enterprise signed whatsapp you could see
        Not surprised SysSecInfo got pulled.
        Btw I thank @officialmcafee so much for pulling stunt with the backdoored whatsapp copie - it is exactly what our app would allow you to see
        But hey knowing that you phone runs a different copy of whatsapp than all other phones will just confuse you
        Stupid iOS autocorrection turns all my your into you
        :/ I may not always agree with @i0n1c, but this is kind of bullshit, @AppStorehttps://twitter.com/theregister/status/732004607812075520 ...

        So if anyone asks you what real threat our app would protect you against just point at the whatsapp story featuring @officialmcafee

        Btw comparing CD hashes does not work to verify same app,cause Apple built iOS to make reproducible builds impossible.But you can see signer
        And with the new version you can verify that at least part of the codesigning info matches.
        Btw I always wondered why Apple encrypts text segments of apps. It has no security purpose at all cause it can be removed in a second.
        And at the same time encrypting text segments means you cannot verify that two apps are exactly the same. So it is anti security feature

        Scamming people into buying an app is not enough to terminate you from AppStore but beware of those security apps...

        The only reason our app is pulled and not the others that show system info/jailbreak status is because we put a dent in "unbreakable iOS"
        Oh you might also want to check who signed NewsStand app on your phone. If it says HackingTeam you might be in trouble 
        Everyone who is like: but kernel rootkit!!! Average iOS user will not be attacked by this but by enterprise/dev signed apps with backdoors.
        I bet autocorrect led to way more user confusions world wide than our app ever will.
        . @tihmstar APPLE is as arrogant as "unbreakable Oracle" when it comes to security
        @i0n1c once again Apple want to keep any possible security issue quiet. 99% assume their iPhone is safe. We know otherwise....
        . @tihmstar I want the app re-instated. Or Apple offering the same functionality (cs viewer and a same binary verification) to stock OS
        . @tihmstar even if Apple really wants to block apps from getting this info they always can give us (or whoever their trust) entitlements
        God what is wrong is autocorrect these days.
        what is going under here is that malicious apps can collect what other apps you use in iOS 9 and the only reason they will get stopped is us
        You know your kernel #fuzzer is doing well when it starts trashing your hypervisor following a #BSOD on the guest.pic.twitter.com/YgLEnEeJ3K

        Also they keep ignoring the big question: why kill us and not the other jailbreak detectors or system info tools or iokit using tools...
        Also funny the assumption that HackingTeam's backdoored newsstand app was supposed to be installed by victims themselves...

        As an OS vendor, you have a responsibility towards your users.
        Providing tools to allow people to safely purchase applications is one thing.
        Treating the installed userbase as an asset to be harvested for the benefit of other corporations is precisely what botnets do.
        Just as DRM can be seen as legalized ransomware, walled-garden ad pushing is a legal version of the botnet, w/ OS vendor as C&C.
        The user is forced to trust the vendor of their OS to get anything done.
        And it's understandable that the vendor wants profit.
        The old fashioned concept of "nobilesse oblige" might be apropos here: you have a privileged position; you are obligated responsibility.
        The feudal lords had obligations to keep their tenants safe and cared for - if they didn't, there would be a revolt.
        In the same way, if your OS promotes a walled garden model, you have obligations to your users to keep them safe and cared for.
        By taking on this power, you have inherently made yourself responsible for your users' well-being.
        Exploiting them is -not- an appropriate response.

        There's a lot of buzz surrounding Hitler at the moment. Is it Hitler?https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/732106434033373184 ... 
        Somewhere in London, a marketing Tarquin leans back in his chair and asks, "Does anyone have the number for this Hitler guy's agent?"
        I'm not saying the sandwich I've just eaten was dry, but it was the sort of sandwich Hitler would make us eat if we left/stayed in the EU.
        It was like the human race got bored with progress. "Being better is hard," they seemed to say. "Let's retreat into the ooze of ignorance."

        This! Also: having per-app sandboxes, rather per-domain, is usually meaningless (at least user data security-wise).https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/732154449532223488 ... 
        Consider e.g. "PDF Viewer" app: it opens all sorts of PDFs there: work, personal, sensitive, garbage, etc. If app compromised can steal all.
        Cool, but: how can the user know if using the original (i.e. non-subverted) @i0n1c's app?https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/732173335061204992 ... 
        @rootkovska by freshly reinstalling the app from store. You can do that even though it is pulled (as long you bought before)

        What I want: summon with a keystroke on OSX, do basic math + binary ops, and easily convert dec/hex/oct/bin.

        If it involves switching to a terminal, it's not summoned with a keystroke.
        The Alfred thing is neat (I'm a Quicksilver person though) but fails the "basic math" test.
        ok ok ok trying alfred
        OK Alfred is better than Quicksilver. I am at least happy about that.
