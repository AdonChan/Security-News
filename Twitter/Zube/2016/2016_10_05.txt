        That's right, you can enable adblocking for IE, Firefox, and Chrome with simple Group Policy. Did you know IE has adblocking? No you didn't.
        Enabling adblocking cuts out virtually all browser exploitation, coerced redirection for malware/tech support scams, and more.
        Most of this content, like for Firefox and IE, is completely my original research. I hope it helps you or fellow Windows admins.

        October is National Cybersecurity Awareness month, which, my instincts notwithstanding, is apparently an Actual Thing.
        Consider my awareness heightened.
        I don't know how long we've been saying, "you know what would fix this cyber stuff? An Awareness Month. That's what we need."
        A lot of the last minute questions I'm getting from students before their project is due probably should have been first minute questions.

        .@TonyAtamanuik and @JAdomian actually understand the people they are impersonating. This is so much better than SNLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Poi5x0E2CM ... 
        Someone should profile Lorne Michaels and his politics.
        SNL doesn't do actual political satire. It does mild mockery of personal foibles. Look at Will Ferrell's amiable well-meaning foolish Bush.
        Alec Baldwin's Trump was actually milder than Trump himself.
        To be clear, I think Saturday Night Live can be really funny. It's just not political satire.

        I get the cynicism towards anti-monopoly rhetoric. The thing is, it's not just another leftie thing. The urgency is coming from business.
        In many ways anti-monopoly does not sit naturally on the left. Its traditional base is centrist small businessmen and farmers.
        It isn't leftwing activists buying seeds and chemicals from Monsanto, it's farmers.
        Amazon is taking aim at retailers, the fashion industry, publishers, and FedEx. Not left-wing urban elites, who largely love Amazon.

        I'm going to put the @SysCast_Online podcast on hold for a couple of weeks/months, it's busy enough as it is.
        It's a bit like open source: starting a project is all fun and games, but keeping it up is the real challenge.
        So it's not cancelled, just on hold. I do really like podcasting, but damn it's time intensive to schedule, record & edit.
