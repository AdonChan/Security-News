        Michael O'Donoghue said that only in America could serial killers become celebrities, complete with character names: Zodiac, Son of Sam, etc
        Marilyn Manson added to this by yoking murderers' names to sex symbols: Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Gidget Gein.
        But like so much else, American killer folklore has decayed, leaving us with George Zimmerman.
        If a counterculture existed, young artists might strip Zimmerman down to his disgusting core, exposing, mocking, then dispensing of his ass
        But there is no counterculture: only a flat line of endless ads where Zimmerman sells his gun. And you're still surprised by Trump?

        News Flash: no algorithm is neutral. Anything built by humans using human data has human biases which will be amplified at scale.
        It will eventually be intellectually dishonest to write stories about how algorithms and data are less objective than we assume

        PSA: No your iPhone was not hacked Instagram made this change itself.
        . @drspringfield disclosing bugs by putting them into an AppStore app is also only way to get a bug bounty for Apple security problems

        For iOS 10 I would like to see an Apple certified/entitled process info tool that lets you inspect codesigning info of what is running.
        If Apple is serious about security they need to allow defenders to look under the hood of devices. BlackBoxes only good for attackers.

        The numbers from AppStore claim 458 guys installed updates of our app. Since there is no update since Monday I wonder how they did that ...
        Collecting donations for a jailbreak brings way more revenue than leading the App Store worldwide for a few days with 1$ app.
        Question for @citizenlab What is the latest iOS FF/HT sample that was found in the wild?
        . @qwertyoruiopz because you retweeted @csoghoian who has selective reading: he only reads the parts that underline his view of the world
        So far not a single dissident reported his iPhone being secretly jailbroken. No bad jailbreaks in the wild it seems.
        It could also be that dissidents don't know about the app because the usual privacy crowd is not recommending the tool. Afraid of data?
        Version 1.0.4 of the app will have this ...pic.twitter.com/c0sbAZOb5f

        . @Casper_O @MacRumors no Apple keeps our Top 1 app already for 3 days in limbo waiting for important bugfix resulting in bad reviews...
        If we ever get our apps reviewed again at some point this will be in ...pic.twitter.com/zPH3bfru3H
        Give a man a fish and feed him for a day.
        Today we have crossed 50k AppStore downloads in total across the whole world.
        People will missunderstand. All sales for the whole week together 50k
        People completely ignore that a lot of people buy our app cause it is the only app with a process list in iOS 9 not cause of jb detection
        LOL we just received a threat by email. Guy wants to snitch us to the AppStore for using undocumented API.
        Guy writes into our website contact form that he wants an email address he can contact instead ...pic.twitter.com/UqVRaUdcxV
        I wonder how anyone working in customer relations for more than a week can keep his sanity.
        same form lead to someone writing a bad review in the AppStore saying he doesn't know GPG and therefore we make it impossible to contact us

        I also love the fact that someone in Philly Gov found the need not just to impersonate Google, but also the State Police for parking.

        Dreamed that someone had written an MMORPG where you built startups and it was just delivery drones repeatedly flying into doors
        Thoughts on Signal and freedom: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/42728.html 
        The reason I'm focusing on Signal rather than federated alternatives is that Signal has proven far more successful than them
        Where there's a well-established project that comes so close to being everything we want, it makes sense to try to help it be what we want
        Ignoring the things that have made it successful and concentrating on an entirely different technology doesn't seem like the best way to win
        And to be clear here - when I say "win" I mean "provide strong security on entirely free platforms". Victory should benefit users, not devs.

        Requiring anyone who issues a 1099 to pay employer portion of tax would do more for "gig" workers than any other scheme I've heard yet
        It would also circumvent "dependent" vs indy contractor BS. Everyone is dependent on the income they earn, whether from one source or 20.
        The only real way to prevent worker misclassification is to make it less attractive as a means to cut costs.

        Doppler effect can be used to bypass jamming: reception from a moving vehicle to get a carrier frequency shift of transmitter vs. jammer 1/3
        yet Google for "Doppler jamming" (no quotes) finds radar jamming techniques (DRFM, paper on FPGA implementation). Why pro-jamming focus? 2/3
        Is the Doppler frequency shift from movement typically too small to significantly help against jamming? Or too obvious / non-scientific? 3/3
        I once listened to 2 shortwave receivers 2m apart tuned to same freq, with a ~1s audio delay. Trip around earth, ~7x slower due to skywave?
        Per Occam's razor, the trip around earth explanation is likely wrong; could be slightly diff freq or multiple TX or diff skywave propagation
