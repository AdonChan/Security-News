        This is of course extremely biased towards our own existence being a notable phenomena in the larger picture, but I digress.
        There is poetic symmetry in how universes are incepted with unlimited possibility, and what you do in your mind with a story on a page.
        In that moment, you, a creature inhabiting the tiniest sliver of existence, are the multiverse.
        When I start a story, that's what I'm thinking about. The universe you're creating for me to inhabit.

        .@baconmeteor They did call them terrorists. Being Christian is irrelevant, doesn't say to kill Muslims via Bible so no religious influence.
        Morality aside, if the Bible said to kill Muslims, it would at least be an impressive bit of prophecy. But it's all "kill the Amalekites"

        Cyber-War I will be fought with 0-days and implants.
        This "cyber-strike against Russia" story is out-weirding the Yahoo email & the NSA TAO hoarder stories.
        The least weird explanation is the story is a deliberate, tactical leak, which is still pretty weird. Seems to invite an escalated response.
        My (hopeful) assumption is that this is a public move in a mostly non-public chess game that both sides more fully understand.

        And yes, I know, it's Coen, not Cohen. I was excited. So sue me.
        Insecure electronic voting systems do not mean elections are "rigged". But it makes it harder to refute crackpot claims they are.
        We should absolutely replace the insecure voting systems used in some states. But there are other safeguards. Imperfect, but not "rigged".
        We are heading toward the nightmare scenario e-voting security researchers worry about: a losing candidate who points to security flaws.
        I've studied these systems pretty carefully. This the exact scenario that I've worried about. Not actual rigging, but the claim of rigging.
        This is a problem with significant nuance that gets easily lost. The systems ARE insecure. But it has to be understood in perspective.
        Assuming we survive this election, we should remember to fix this before the next one.

        86% says the economy is rigged to benefit corporations. 46% say it's rigged to benefit white people.
        51.5% are unsatisfied with the current choices for President.
        This is a sullen populist electorate that feels powerless but not hopeless. They see bankers, the rich, and politicians as dominant.
        They largely see the poor, minorities, immigrants, and the middle class as not getting any special favors from the political system.
        15% of 55-65 year olds are paying student debt.
        The idea that the economic system is rigged for politician, bankers, and the wealthy is held by upwards of 85% of the public.
        In 2016, political scientists on the fainting couch about voters losing faith in democracy are bad at their jobs. Where were you years ago?
        73% of Americans fear not having saved enough for retirement, 56% fear losing their job in the next year.
        41% fear not being able to make a car payment.
        71% fear facing an unexpected medical bill.
        57% of respondents say that good jobs are hard to find where they live. https://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/anxiety-index-data.pdf ... 
        This is a country that is not divided, but united in distrust of bankers, politicians, and the wealthy. A realignment awaits.
        @matthewstoller most of my peers have household incomes of 400-600k (early 30s) and they would all agree with this statement.

        John Birchers believed that Eisenhower was a Communist in the 1950s.
