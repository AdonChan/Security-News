        Trump's pick for head of the EPA thinks "climate change" is a bullying tactic of the left.http://westword.com/news/scott-pruitt-trumps-new-epa-chief-backed-by-frackers-keen-on-coal-8579379 ... 
        EXPOSED: Federal regulators just shielded Apple from shareholder push to force company to reduce carbon emissionshttp://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/how-apple-could-block-climate-change-vote-sec-limits-shareholder-power-2458093 ... 
        Journalism is important, but its absurd & ridic to assert that subscribing to a nat'l newspaper is a form of civic engagement/protest 1/x
        The election proved lots of media content is meaningless noise - and that even good journalism has far less impact than it once had 2/x
        For business purposes, legacy media orgs are now trying to promote the idea that giving them money is a post-election way to fight back 3/x
        But many of these legacy media outlets often use their power to narrow the political debate and promote the elite's political vision 4/x
        It's fun to think that defending democracy = clicking a link to subscribe to the NY Times. But that effete notion is laughable (5/x)
        The hard truth: defending democracy will require a lot more than a newspaper subscription -- it'll require actually getting involved (6/x)
        Defending democracy means more people finding the courage to step into the arena & do the hard unglamorous work of civic engagement (7/7)
        The SEC just shielded Apple from a shareholder initiative to force the company to reduce its carbon emissionshttp://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/how-apple-could-block-climate-change-vote-sec-limits-shareholder-power-2458093 ... 
        Worth adding: I (obviously!) value journalism & my fellow investigative journos. But it alone wont/can't save us.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/807693452142145536 ...

        If you told me last year that @TeenVogue would be at the cutting edge of political journalism in 2016, I would have politely laughed.https://twitter.com/TeenVogue/status/807634334903635969 ... 
        Search warrants have had jurisdictional limits on them. Rule 41 changes that. Learn more here from @EFF + @RonWydenhttp://wny.cc/2U3z306Zgqc 
        2016: "Scientists have had too much influence since the enlightenment and it's time to give ignorance and superstition another chance."
        The tragedy isn't that @TeenVogue is respecting its readers with real political analysis, but that it stands out so much for doing so.
        So now the major political parties are shaping up to be the FBI and the CIA? That doesn't seem great.
        Trump seems to be at war with the intel community and the State Department; this can't end well.
        I'd think it healthy for a president to be skeptical of intel, but this seems to go well beyond, to the point of hampering foreign policy.

        UOPX is not public, but it gets ~90% of its revenue from federal programs. This adds up to billions of dollars in recent years!

        17) the email accounts dumped on DC Leaks were targeted by same spear phishing campaign as John Podesta, whose email Wikileaks  published.
        18) That same spear phishing campaign used infrastructure from earlier attacks on NATO targets by group called APT28 (Fancy Bear)
        19) Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear (APT29) malware were found by investigators on DNC network. Guccifer 2.0 only emerged after attribution.
        20) Wikileaks dumps of Podesta mails included spearphish message that compromised his account.
        21) Wikileaks, contrary to things Dems said, did not alter anything. Russia's Sputnik changed meaning of 1 email, touching off accusations.
        22) For now, conclusions are left as an exercise for the reader.
        So did Russia hack the US election? Here's a walk-through of what we actually know outside anonymous leaks from the USG.https://twitter.com/thepacketrat/status/807700893735014400 ...

        2. I've been saying Trump is a fascist for over 14 months. People weren't listening, so I got a Twitter account and started shouting.
        3. I'm not a raving lunatic. I have a PhD from Harvard in political theory. I know something about these subjects. This is real.
        What would be worse- if the US election was manipulated by the Russian govt, or if it was manipulated by an angry spam botnet operator?
