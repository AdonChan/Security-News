        But @mailynfidler didn't get intimate with Stuxnet and so she doesn't have the bugs straight - MS08-067 was patched before put in stuxnet
        What @mailynfidler is thinking about is the other spooler bug, which was in a Russian paper. . .maybe we READ that paper to get it?
        Mara always chides me a bout being mean to non-technical policy people like @mailynfidler but THIS IS WHY. They don't know the field.
        In addition, reading her post, @mailynfidler does not understand the main arguments in the lawfareblog article Matt and I did.
        . @mailynfidler doesn't have the facts or the policy right in her rebuttal. My contention is that without the facts, you cannot make policy.
        That whole paragraph on Conficker as it applies to 0day policy should be considered gross malpractice.https://www.justsecurity.org/32697/vulnerability-equities-process-intelligence-community/ ... 
        The argument @pwnallthethings and I made was that the VEP is pure PR - regardless of intentions, it doesn't work and cannot work.
        We acknowledged that the US claims an interest in a safer, more secure Internet of Commerce.
        Also I don't recall @pwnallthethings recommending "bulk disclosure" in the lawfareblog post. Nothing she said in her rebuttal makes sense.
        http://cybersecpolitics.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-tech-does-not-support-vep.html ...  A rebuttle to the rebuttle.
        @daveaitel It's a hell of a stretch to say "reporting 0day one-by-one makes little or no diff" = "Recommendation to disclose 0day in bulk".
        Hey @daveaitel - I heard Bas wrote a capstone binding for FUCKING EMACS. Can you beat him up for me?

        EU continue to diverge sharply from the voluntary character of international arms control arrangements like #Wassenaar... 
        And in the process risk eroding the efficacy of such arrangements as confidence building measures (CBMs) for traditional arms control.
        Given how well we've observed ICT security controls to work in this regulatory medium, one has to ask : are they worth it?

        The EU takes a mere 44% of UK exports whereas Australia sucks up a mighty 1.4%. Why doom mongers are so negative about Brexit is beyond me.
        At the risk of saying something deeply offensive, but ... a lot of the Wassenaar "surveillance software" discussion seems to have a ...
        ... strong undercurrent of imperialist thought: "Save brown people from white technology that they can't build themselves".
        Perhaps it would also make sense to ask: When do human rights concerns trump sovereignty? And may a democracy decide against human rights?
        In general, I recommend reading about the origins of Westphalian Sovereignty. A lot of international relations don't make sense otherwise.

        There is no set of principles for including/excluding conference speakers that can't be gamed somehow by trolls or zealots.
        You have to judge each decision on a case-by-case basis. You can't say "exclusion always bad", or "inclusion always good".

        Standard library API suggestion: make your math/random (non-crypto random) annoying  to seed. People will use crypto just as a shortcut.
