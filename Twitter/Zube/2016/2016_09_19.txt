        #LittleFlocker Beta 7 will open the manual for you. Beta 8 will read it for you using text to speech. Beta 9 swears and uninstalls itself.
        @JZdziarski Just as long as Beta 10 doesn't install a free McAfee trial...
        @JZdziarski Beta 10 should encrypt all your files until you read the documentation
        The 20160918 nightly build of #LittleFlocker is really rocking on speed and UI improvements. Highly recommend a test drive.
        iOS 10 adoption is at 83% for Geekbench 4.

        You say "identity theft", I say "a strangely socially acceptable discourse by which financial institutions shift fraud risk to consumers."
        I've made #LittleFlocker a private repo; I'll push Beta 7 on http://littleflocker.com  soon. Sorry, but the OSS community is too disparaging.

        Chelsea is busy with restaurants, etc, but it's not a top business district or Times Square-level tourist icon. Wonder what motive was.
        Also, not yet confirmed, AFAIK, if the 27th St pressure cooker device was an actual bomb or a simulated bomb, or if anyone has taken credit.
        Mayor @BilldeBlasio, @NYPDONeill, @FDNY, @NewYorkFBI to update all on yesterday's explosion in Chelsea. LIVE at noon https://www.facebook.com/NYPD/ 
        49 and 50 between Park and Lex now closed off for UNGA week. Lots of dignitaries at Waldorf and Intercontinental hotels.
        POTUS, however, now stays at the Lotte Palace a block west.
        Across from the Palace, this communications trailer, with lots of wideband antennas.pic.twitter.com/L3e8s1SrFs
        For the record, that is NOT my trailer.
        The trailer has a VHF/UHF biconical plus a UHF/SHF discone on the mast, 2  (probably) cellular sticks & a cheap VHF/UHF discone on the roof.
        ... Government plates (apparently Navy); almost certainly operated by WHCA.
        My guess would be chiefly local area spectrum monitoring, although they also had some portable base stations in crates next to it.
        I would say it must be fun to travel with all that RF gear, but that's close to how I travel as it is. Though without all the armed guards.
        Almost all the NYPD channels are unencrypted and widely monitored. Last night showed why that's a good idea; helped prevent crazy rumors.
        Encryption for public safety radio makes sense for surveillance and certain tactical things; much less so for normal dispatch.
        All 29 people injured last evening in the Chelsea explosion have been released from the hospital.pic.twitter.com/cEWdtWdryI
        All the following information is preliminary
        There are two active crime scenes: West 23 Street and West 27 Street. The device that exploded on W23St was done intentionally.
        Preliminary evidence of the device that exploded at West 23 Street suggests it was an improvised explosive device (IED)
        The suspicious device on W27St was safely removed earlier this morning by NYPD Bomb Squad to a secure police facility.
        The buildings in the area were checked by @FDNY & @NYCBuildings and deemed to be structurally stable.
        The NYPD Bomb Squad is currently analyzing the West 27 Street device at a secure NYPD facility in the Bronx.

        Not discussed much today, but a big issue in the next few years is going to be Chinese control over key American industries.
        Since money and corporate power sluices into American politics, this will intersect with China in unusual ways.
        It isn't traditional attempt to manipulate the superpower into doing their bidding, it's an attempt to displace American power. New problem.

        This is having its biggest effect on prices paid to farmers & ranchers. Monopsony as big a problem as monopoly
        also makes collective bargaining for grocery workers more difficult. Downward pressure on wages, benefits.
        .@ddayen And encourages concentration elsewhere in the supply chain

        This seems...  suboptimal?

        I can't directly comment on recent FSF-related discussion, but some have been "defending" the FSF using transphobic and misogynistic abuse.
        This is disgusting and incompatible with our goal of building communities that are welcoming regardless of race, gender or sexuality
        If you want to be part of a development community that's tolerant of discriminatory abuse, I hear ESR has one. This isn't it.

        Beware of propaganda. Always ask yourself why things are being reported -

        Oof. Didn't get home 'til late. Will have to put off rants for later.
        You say "identity theft", I say "a strangely socially acceptable discourse by which financial institutions shift fraud risk to consumers."
        n.b. Discourse of identity theft often functions to assume conclusion that Alice was asking for it by being negligent regarding security.
        Alice has often done negligent things like shopping at a grocery store, handing her card to a waiter, writing a check, or having a job.
        (There are plenty of other vectors for it, too, some where Alice bears meaningful responsibility, and some which are just maddening.)
        (A particularly unfun one: Alice's estranged Mother Mildred opened an account with Bob using Alice's details because Mildred is a criminal.)
        (If Mildred had stolen money from Bob using a gun Bob would deal with it, but she stole it using a pen, and so it is Alice's problem.)
        Seems to me sane resolution is we make it straightforward for Alice to bill Bob for negative externalities of Bob's business decision here.

        The "all unreads" thing in Slack is Satanic; evidence of active, urgent work in the service of evil.
        The squashes are harvested. The gates are assembled. Time to learn how to "think like a master programmer" from ESR.
        The first thing I'm learning is that you couldn't count on your C compiler having 64-bit long long until 2008.
        ... many paragraphs in and that's still all I'm learning from the master... 
        ...  ok now he's making a 64 bit integer LIBRARY with its own INTERFACE. i wonder how he'd tackle sudoku... 
        O.O https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec/commit/13fa1219f94d2b9ec00ae409ac4b54ee12b1e93f ...  (this is a single 64 bit integer, or two 32 bit ints packed)
        "Word to the newbies: this is how it's done."
        ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahapic.twitter.com/SaLa2aUBYA
        $50 to the charity of your choice if you can name a compiler for a 32+ bit arch that didn't support "long long"/eqvt in 1995.
        "Equivalent" includes LP64 compilers that emit a 64 bit "long" and a 32 bit "int".
        As a parent and a cryptographer I'm very concerned by this.https://twitter.com/maxiryo/status/776949995505233920 ...
