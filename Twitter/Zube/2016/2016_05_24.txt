        2. DM this third party with the following:
        3. Third party may reply with "yes" or "no"; no further explanation is required.
        4. If "yes", then the third party shall DM the second party with the following:
        5. Second party may respond with "yes" or "no". No further explanation is required.
        6. If no, third party shall respond "The request was declined" to the first party. No further explanation is required.
        7. If yes, the second party shall unblock the first party.
        If anyone's got a better protocol idea, feel free - this is just a suggestion for how to do it politely.

        Some things today's Guardian article on NSA whistleblowers won't tell you:
        1. Thomas Drake didn't comply with protocol for whistleblowing at NSA. He created a Hushmail account and used it to send dox to reporters.
        The string "Hushmail" occurs nowhere in the article. Is DOJ lying in the Drake indictment? That would be a big story.
        2. Drake is famous for blowing the whistle on Trailblazer, a Bush-era dragnet scheme. But he sponsored ThinThread, a different dragnet.
        Both ThinThread (Drake) and Trailblazer apparently had, as core purpose, enabling surveillance that involved US targets.
        3. The kernel of the article is that NSA/DOJ violated "The Whistleblower Protection Act", much of which doesn't apply to intelligence.
        The core claim, really: Drake lodged formal complain in NSA. NSA IG leaked complaint to DOJ. DOJ investigated Drake, found Hushmail.
        Had NSA not leaked to DOJ, Drake's exfil of NSA documents might not have been discovered. But they'd still have happened!
        Of the NSA leakers, Drake is the most sympathetic. Not trying to litigate Drake's case. Rather: this article does a poor job of REPORTING.
