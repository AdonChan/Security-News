        Because I will let Apple ship a brand new AppleTV4 to the winner the one that was sitting for a year in my desk is still up for grabs.
        This means there will be another giveaway for that AppleTV 4 in a few weeks. I will keep you posted.
        I have been asked several times for the lottery script. I will upload it later today to my github
        I guess now I should buy a TV ....there's no postponing anymore....

        LOL. Ordering the AppleTV for the giveaway winner resulted in my creditcard being blocked.
        Soviel zum 24 Stunden Kreditkartenservice der @DeutscheBank (wir haben paranoid ihre Karte gesperrt? Rufen sie am 27 wieder an)
        Ich frage mich ja wie Kreditkartenbetrug Ã¼berhaupt jemals erfolgreich sein kann so paranoid wie MasterCard immer legale Buchungen blockiert.
        Who would have guessed that using a german @MasterCard *TRAVEL* to buy something in UK AppleStore gets your credit card blocked 
        So what other bank in Germany offers something like @MasterCard Travel so that I can move my bank accounts away from @DeutscheBank
        Kiddies still bother me regarding the iOS 10.2 jailbreak. That is exactly why the team working on it doesn't disclose this.
