        Bored this thanksgiving?  Watch me and @nudehaberdasher's 2016 BH talk about advanced CAN message injectionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgEmNlu20c ... 
        Find out how hard it is to control most vehicles by only injecting CAN messages, but how the heroes of the story overcame these obstacles.
        I'd say, among other accolades, that @barnaby_jack was the father of stunt hacking and someone I really looked up to.https://twitter.com/todayininfosec/status/801181220960878592 ... 
        Wanted to mess with the battery firmware hacking I did in 2011.  Can't find any of my old tools.  Had to get them from the wayback machine.
        Huh, since I did that talk on battery hacking, Apple hasn't released an update tool for the battery, thats funny ;) https://support.apple.com/downloads/Battery%2520update ...

        We're living a version of "Brewster's Millions" where Trump has 26 days in which to fail so hard that the Electoral College gets cold feet
        Remember: in order for 2016 to crush every morsel of hope, you have to keep hoping. So hope with me for an electoral college shocker Dec 19

        @Pinboard The plan all along was to make Trump think all is safe and sound when suddenly @sama launches his series of Medium thinkpieces
        Maybe Facebook could borrow Google's "Don't Be Evil" slogan for a while. They're not using it.
        If I ever start a company, I'm going to call it 'Employee' so I can call the people who work for me 'employees' and not sound cringy
        Tech companies, deciding whether to collaborate with Trump is not an agonizing trolley problem. It's the moral equivalent of tee-ball.
        Deciding whether to work with Trump and his supporters doesn't require moral calculus, or even moral algebra. Right @sama?
        Facebook: look, fake news is a hard problem.
        It will be kind of marvelous if Trump abandons all his right-wing campaign promises and governs on a centrist platform of pure corruption
        I worry @sama's keyboard is broken, so here's a thing he can cut and paste: "No, we are not collaborating with Thiel to affect Trump policy"

        The nature of e-voting technology makes it very difficult to either prove or disprove tampering. That said, there could be forensic clues.
        Bottom line is I look forward to reviewing their findings; this is a credible group of genuine experts.
        By the way, if you want to rant about how either this "obviously" proves the election was stolen or "obviously" is BS, please remove me.
        Remembering The Strangest (And Still Unexplained) TV Hack In Chicago History
        Whatever the outcome, if we're going to hold elections, can we PLEASE get rid of voting systems that make it hard to be sure who won?
        Alex Halderman definitely has the gravitas to command attention here, but I hope his report is published soon so it can speak for itself.
        And before you ask; I've not seen the report, and I'm not privy to any of the details.
        Anyone know if it's possible to enable encryption when formatting a new disk under OS X Sierra? Or can you only do it on an existing volume?
        Believe whatever you want, but if you're claiming Halderman and co aren't experts on election tech, you're WAY off base.
        I'm just going to keep repeating this.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/801258942248718337 ... 
        Important update: @NYMag misrepresented Halderman's position somewhat, but he makes a persuasive recount case here: https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba#.6dgi10mhz ... https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/801245467648688128 ...

        A difference between scientists and almost everyone else is if you regard results that contradict your views as threatening or exciting.
        In particular, disproving current belief is heavily REWARDED in science. (But extraordinary claims still require extraordinary evidence).
        This is one reason why claims that "the science establishment is keeping this discovery down" are almost always BS.

        Trump's team is talking about abolishing the FCC. This means killing the open internet.
        But we have to be honest. The Obama FCC allowed massive telecom mergers and did nothing about monopoly power.
        And now the laudable regulatory mandates they did pursue will be brushed aside more easily precisely b/c they allowed monopoly to fester.
        The lesson should be that regulatory rules of the road must be paired with structural changes to reduce concentrated power.
        FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler did a great job w/in the intellectual confines he was placed. He's heroic. But those confines are too narrow.
