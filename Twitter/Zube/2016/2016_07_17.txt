        if you guys read Curzio Malaparte ( technique of coup d'etat) , you will understand that conditions were not satisfied. #TurkeyCoupAttempt
        One of the reasons the #TurkeyCoup was a failure, the mastermind himself was not even in the country. He did not read "Malaparte".
        Another reason of #TurkeyCoup failure is the media control. The Bolsheviks would have shutdown Twitter and Internet ;)
        Another reason  #TurkeyCoup failure. Turkey don't have smart masterminds such as Trotsky and Kerensky. The latest is a great social engineer
        killing civilian during a coup d'etat is the stupidest thing ever. #TurkeyCoup is one of the dumbest ever. The strategy was a failure.
        or maybe the #TurkeyCoup was only a comedy and fake diversion. Honestly even the dumbest strategist will never go for a coup in Turkey

        I'm guessing a lot (most?) of the "productivity" increase in big cities is just implied rent:http://www.vox.com/2016/5/29/11805060/big-small-county-growth ... 
        When rent rises due to demand, we measure that as an increase in productivity. The value of "housing services" is assumed to go up.

        Meanwhile. back in America....https://twitter.com/LACoFDPIO/status/753637301268328448 ... 
        I believe the coup has failed, It is now clear it wasn't that large or full chain-of-command. Erdogan blames Gulenists; a plausible option.
        But requires sensible curation of retweets & good BS detection instincts. Skepticism & critical analysis are increasingly important skills.
        Can we have a quiet news day today, please?
