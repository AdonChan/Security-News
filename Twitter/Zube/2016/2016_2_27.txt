        I've been asked who I voted for. You really want to know? 
        (Should have voted for Barry Commoner that year. I was a kid.)
        1984: Voted for Mondale/Ferraro. My girlfriend insisted, and he still lost.
        1992: Didn't vote. Hated the Clintons.
        2004: John Kerry. Please forgive me.
        2012: I called that election within eight minutes. Fuck Nate Silver.

        Without Apple's help, the FBI has resorted to extreme methods to unlock the iPhone.
        Q: Will Apple fix Secure Enclave?

        The FBI is requesting an $85M increase in its cyber budget for 2017. Â¹ Â²

        Re: AWA "Necessity" prong; only Apple could sign #FBiOS, but nothing stopping FBI from writing it. Obviously, not exploring all avenues.
        When you arrest a suspect, FBI knows it's hard to interview them if you shoot them. Also hard to interview a phone if you've shut it down.
        @JZdziarski Shutdown, ask questions later!
        FBI should take on the same burden they want Apple to and hire people to write a tool. Then we'll only be arguing if signing compels speech.
        NSA doesn't care about this case because they're in the business of compromising targets _before_ FBI has gone and screwed up the evidence.

        If Apple would automatically wipe a phone whenever your iCloud password is changed, that'd work great, because you never change it yourself.

        Five minutes explaining this case to a DA changed her mind in favor of Apple. This is why Apple is trying to educate the public about this.

        If a POTUS Trump decides to build the great wall of Trump, it will be a surprisingly big investment into public infrastructure <g>.
        @halvarflake Maybe. But it is public infrastructure without positive, but with negative productivity effects. Even pyramids would be better.
        This article is an interesting and difficult read for me: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0 ...  - and I disagree with the focus. (1/3)
        Yes, a good team climate requires psychological safety (e.g. everybody feels safe) and equality (everybody is heard), but I think that (2/3)
        "professionalism" (e.g. ability to deal with your own emotions and criticism w/o impacting others negatively) is as important (3/3)
        "Trust" within a team is important, and complex. A culture where nobody ever has to be afraid to speak out is crucial. But there are (1/2)
        so many facets to it. The most important thing is that everybody needs to trust their teammates to never have malicious intent. (2/2)

        I wrote new FOSS code for work in my free time, and now I've spent tons of time at work with its deployment packaging/plan/etc.
        Packaging and deployment *sucks* when you're a developer and just want to write code. Which is prolly why so many projects such at it.
        These projects should get friendly with sysadmin types, though, instead of being all "put it in its own docker YOLO!"
        We use something FOSS at work that, when it moved to a different data center, I didn't upgrade it because there was no clear path for that.

        Building a safe Tor router has some complexities and bad edge cases. The security it provides is different than using naked TBB.
        Simply installing Tor as a transparent proxy on a Linux device (router or RPi or whatever) is not sufficient. It simply isn't.
        Effectively using a Tor router to mitigate the risk of malware (such as NIT) w/o simultaneously deanonymising yourself due to error is hard
