        I mean, you can try to serve an All Writs warrant to the Truecrypt developers. If you can find them.
        The most significant @snowden revelation wasn't new tech, it was that our government violated the good faith and trust we put in them.
        Truecrypt was originally written by a multi-millionaire international arms dealer named Paul LeRoux. https://mastermind.atavist.com/he-always-had-a-dark-side ... 
        FBI got into San Bernardino killer's iPhone without Apple's help http://bit.ly/25tfChh  by @JennaMC_Laugh
        TrueCrypt's warning looks to have changed to "TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues".
        You should get a good idea of the capabilities of this new FBI tool by what other cases get dropped this week, and which move forward.
        If the FBI's solution only works with 5c/9.0.x, then it's a software exploit that only requires minor kernel offset changes to expand.
        If FBI had forced Apple for backdoor, the technique outlined in the AWA order would've destroyed more data than the private technique used.
        I don't know the exact technique used, but based on statements from FBI and court briefs, it's obvious they did a disk dump, not unlock.
        Elcomsoft Password Breaker seems to call home whenever you download files from iCloud. Wonder if that's how FBI found the Fappening guy.
        Yesterday, FBI signed a $218,004 purchase order to Cellebrite for "IT Supplies" (a.k.a. toilet seat). pic.twitter.com/ngTeoe3AeM
        Cellebrite, when the public criticizes them for assisting FBI. pic.twitter.com/eYlTAOe3P0
        If this $200K is for unlocking Farook's iPhone, I suspect Cellebrite is under NDA with FBI but plans to resell this service to others.
        If Cellebrite is planning to resell this service for $200K a pop, chances are it's viable for many other iPhone models too.
        Open source iCloud backup tools HT @chronic https://github.com/dinosec/iphone-dataprotection/tree/master/python_scripts/icloud ... 
        $200K is too low to sell the rights to a technique, but just right for an unlock service they plan to resell to other agencies.

        @tomtomorrow TBH, I'm pretty sure that something in the Large Hadron Collider went wrong and we're now in a parallel universe.

        I don't think there's enough info to even speculate on how general the method the FBI used to get into the SB phone.
        iPhone 5c under whatever version of iOS with a short PIN and with the auto-erase feature enabled is a pretty specific set of circumstances.
        I marvel at the fact that we now expect, (& almost get) consumer handsets that resist targeted nation-state-level attacks. Pretty high bar.
        @mattblaze What I marvel at more is that the companies selling these are the consumer companies worth $500b, not the specialty vendors.

        So the iPhone crack cost the FBI 15K.

        .@__apf__ And the pwd strength meter @hsimpnet is still dangerously weak imho. Author working on that though, with input from experts.

        Our runner-up pick for the best dash cam, the Vantrue R2, is down to $110 with code 9IJGN585 (from $150) http://wrctr.co/1USJKPo 
        A larger version of our favorite SSD, the Samsung 850 EVO 1TB, is down to $260 http://wrctr.co/1R0v3nf 
        This is a new low by $10. Some accounts also have a 5x Ebay Bucks offer, which would give an additional 10% back on the purchase.
