        Huh, now that I'm not doing security research, I'm not quite sure what to do on the weekend...
        One of the biggest problems in infosec is it's impossible to know who the experts are and who the frauds are.  Has impact on policy, hiring.

        21 USC Â§676 & 9 C.F.R. Â§ 319.760(a) make it a federal crime to sell deviled ham that's too moist.

        Dear women (and men) in #InfoSec, 
        We get complains that PoC||GTFO contains too many articles like X or w/ Y: we'd love to be able to pick articles and balance the content...
        ... but we can't do that as we already have to hunt for potentially good articles to get enough content: roughly half-applied, half-hunted..
        ...so: the more you apply, the more balance we can bring.
        .@anders_fogh that's true [most of the time], and that's great, but OTOH I feel sometimes the same: it's not as varied as I would like.

        What scale of response to that would be appropriate/proportionate? And how do we deter such a thing in advance to avoid having to find out?

        Most annoying feature of iOS is that you cannot recover from forgotten passcode on your own devices. Like try until muscle memory kicks in.
        I keep traveling with travel ipads, having important notes in them and at home i dont use them for 2 month. Passcode forgotten: notes lost.
        Only thing important lost this time is an EFI password for a brand new travel notebook. Guess i have to visit the Apple store in future.
        American out of office: "I'm on vacation but will check email hourly. Reach me on my mobile."
        What exactly is the difference between erase all data after 10 passcode attempts and alternative to lock data forever? Effectively the same.
        Beside the fact that for obvious reasons i do not want to connect travel ipads to my normal computers for backup 
        Haha... OMG after my iPad is now locked due to exceeding the ten attempts I found a place where i had written down the passcode

        [ Why is it -always- the left hand drawer unless the writing ledge is only on the right, anyway? ]
        All of these things are smoke and mirrors to replace the real grunt work that needs doing.
        Cut out the rockstar solutions and do some roadie work, damnit. 
        How many of you know how many computers are connected to your network?
        If you don't even know what's -there- then how can you have a hope of securing 'em?
        If you don't know what these basic practices are, there's a handy guide here:
        Yes, that's from 20 years ago - guess what? It's mostly still valid.
        Work on your basics. Learn them deeply so that they are a part of you.
        And once you've done that, THEN we can talk about more interesting things.
        But honestly - most people will never, ever see an 'advanced' threat actor in the wild.
        If you're a spy, or part of the MIC, then you are allowed to do APT nonsense. 
        It will never be relevant to you! You're hemmoraging from phishing and other low-bar attacks; fix that!
        There's no sense looking for spies in the dark when you are being beaten over the head with a phish!
        Get your priorities in order. Defend against the attacks that you actually -get-.
        Because that's the real scam here, innit? These vendors prey on your ignorance of how you're being attacked.
        And if you aren't controlling your infrastructure -
        Know thyself.
        So there you have it. Ignore the APTs; they aren't relevant to your situation until you've done the basics.
        .@jgoguen The fanciest SIEM out there won't catch a ransomware vector if you haven't hooked it up to the gorram logs.

        Performance and compensation are almost completely UNRELATED. DO NOT wait for your next performance review to ask for a raise.
        Remember: THE MARKET sets your compensation. Your boss's opinion of you has almost nothing to do with it.
        Trump NY co-chair says the Khans don't deserve to be called a Gold Star family
        Twitter is deleting users posting Olympic clips within minutes. They have tools to deal with harassment, but they'll only protect brands.
        It's interesting to look at the language of compensation decisions as an example of language twisted to coerce.
        "You need to be Level II to get another pay raise". What's "Level II" and what's it got to do with market rates?
        "You can look for a higher-paying job but that's mercenary behavior." Am I murdering people to get higher pay? Then probably no, right?
        "Work hard and track your achievements and you'll show you earned a pay raise." "Earned"? Do soybeans "earn" their spot price at CBOT?
        standard, well-defined pay levels : employment :: "no-haggle pricing" : cars.
        21 USC Â§676 & 9 C.F.R. Â§ 319.760(a) make it a federal crime to sell deviled ham that's too moist.
