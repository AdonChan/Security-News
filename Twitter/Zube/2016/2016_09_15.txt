        I wonder if the infoleak pegasus bug described by Pangu is really the right one because it was not fixed at all in 9.3.5
        So if what Pangu writes is true Apple botched fixing the infoleak used by Pegasus in their iOS 9.3.5 update.
        Why am I not shocked? 
        To clarify my earlier Tweet: i know that the bug pangu describe is unfixed in 9.3.5 - what I do not know is if pegasus used that one
        Oh the irony of Apple store genius telling #syssecinfo user that our app is not updated for iOS 10. Not telling him it is 100% Apple's fault
        It seems @snare is a push up monster
        So @citizenlabs not sharing #pegasus samples also had effect that until today it was publicly unknown that #pegasus infoleak fix didn't fix
        More and more people reporting to us that *they called the Apple support* because #syssecinfo shows a jailbreak on iOS 10.

        Bayer's attempt to buy Monsanto is just ridiculous.http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37361556 ... 
        Monsanto has rolled up a good chunk of the seed/chemical business already. It was under investigation for years.http://www.salon.com/2013/03/15/how_did_monsanto_outfox_the_obama_administration/ ... 
        "Since the mid-1990s, the number of independent seed companies has shrunk from some 300 firms to fewer than 100."
        One state lawyer said: ""If a seed company didn't play by Monsanto's rules, it could wipe that company out."
