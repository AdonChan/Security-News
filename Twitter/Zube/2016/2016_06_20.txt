        Also in experimental cooking news, I have obtained a chocolate mold suitable for freezing pumpkin pie filling.
        So the plan is to make said filling and freeze it, then take the frozen filling balls and wrap them in a graham-crust-type dough, then steam
        So I can hopefully obtain pumpkin pie cha siu bao.

        @whitequark make sure you keep cake control rods ready in case you need to scram the cake
        Argh. Reverse-engineering the baking process to try to do it with nonstandard equipment is surprisingly difficult.
        I mean, the physics are OK-ish to model, but then diving into the chemistry of how a cake works...
        There's various reactions for leavening that go off at different times, then maillard reactions for flavorants...
        And then trying to model heat distribution during different components of the baking process as various 'shells' coagulate
        ....damnit, @whitequark - you have entirely nerd-sniped me.
