        I just read the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CherryOS  Wikipedia entry, and as someone who had a front-row seat in 2005, I am amazed by the whitewash.
        If a Wikipedia entry has sections removed because they can't find "evidence", and I was there, how do I "become evidence"? Blog post?
        I am thinking of writing a script that categorizes orders on the degree of useless human being that designed the algo. 1/2
        So I love C++11, but the fact that the right answer to "I want to iterate over a date range" is "use boost" makes me sad/angry/annoyed.

        Almost everywhere else in society, "truth" seems to be political.
        This.https://twitter.com/osxreverser/status/756130798248554496 ... 
        And in a more decentralized society, "truth" is increasingly determined by who has more time to spend behind a keyboard.
        Putin is one of the leaders that has best understood this postmodernist concept of truth, and has an army of trolls to create truth.
        The asymmetry of creation-of-truth vs. debunking is truly stunning.
