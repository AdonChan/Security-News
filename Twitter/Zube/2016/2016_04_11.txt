        @SwiftOnSecurity some companies have dependencies on plugins like deprecated 3rd party IME - therefore stuck on unpatched 2k7 forever.
        @SwiftOnSecurity software dependency caused holes per region/industry really easy to research and a sadly consistent entry point for baddies
        @SwiftOnSecurity companies that do X are going to have software Y and therefore outdated Java version Z for example - highly consistent.

        Grover Cleveland is seriously out of touch with today's Democratic Party. And don't even get me started on Al Smith.
        Grover, I voted for you in 1892. But that was then. The world has changed.
        William Jennings Bryan is not perfect, but he's right about how farmers are being treated and he's our best shot to beat McKinley.
        We elected a Democratic President and Congress in 1893, and what did we get? A financial crisis! No more Grover Cleveland! Bryan or bust!
        I predict a strong William Jennings Bryan victory over McKinley. After all, the populists changed the conversation.

        Someone made a big list of SJWs and I'm not on it? NOW I MUST REDOUBLE MY EFFORTS.
        There's a universe where being on such a list avoids me ever dealing with recruiter mail from excessively terrible companies
        On the other hand, in this universe it's likely to be yet another thing that tends to discriminate against already marginalised groups
        Spend too much time talking about how the landscape of the tech industry is discriminatory? FEWER JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU
