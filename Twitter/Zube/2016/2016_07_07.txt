        Hillary's selling point is that she's "experienced" and "ready to lead." Yet, with the emails she was "careless"; with Iraq, "misled."
        How does someone so "competent" get fooled by, of all people, George W. Bush?!

        vbscript!COleScript::IsUnsafeAllowed in Win10 calls dummy COleScript::OnEnterBreakPoint,while Win 8.1 properly calls QueryProtectedPolicy
        In other words, SafeMode bypass described here http://theori.io/research/cve-2016-0189 ...  is possible against IE 11 on Win 10, but not on Win 8.1. Strange :)

        I can't speak to how safe/secure it is, but installing the Greenify app on my Android phone has made a huge difference to battery life.
        It actively kills and suppresses background execution of the apps you add to its list.
        Biggest diff in batt stats is that Google [Play] Services dropped out entirely, because bg apps were apparently constantly invoking it.

        The Chilcot Report is six years late because that's how long it's taken Blair to emerge from Bush's rectum.
        Might do some hard-hitting satire while sitting poolside in 28° heat and drinking beer. TONY B LIAR MORE LIKE. Okay, that's enough for now.

        Regardless of Chilcot Tony Blair will always be a Mephistophelean shit bag.

        Meanwhile, ISIS has killed a few hundred people over weekend, and we're busy talking about which of our candidates for President lies more.
        Realize that #EricGarner & #AltonSterling were brutally killed for being black while selling (cigarettes & CDs) cheap consumer products.
        Will the tech leaders making billions while ignoring the laws about markets that they enter speak up for these men? Defend them?
        Imagine what "libertarian" Peter Thiel's $10 million could have done for these families. Maybe spend a decade "disrupting" police violence?
        #AltonSterling & #EricGarner were killed by cops for bending the law to far lesser degree than execs at AirBNB & Uber. Billions vs bullets.
        1/ The people I admire most in Baltimore are the ones who hustle every day to make a legal dollar filling a niche. The street entrepreneurs.
        2/ I'll buy that CD. I'll buy that water. I'll hear that pitch. Because as a freelancer I did the same thing every day #GigEconomy
        /3 The main differences between me and them are I gigged indoors and the cops never hassled me for my gigging because of my race.
        /4 So while not having heard everything on #AltonSterling , I still feel outraged. At institutional racism, economic racism.

        If I wanted to be scandalized by a misconfigured mail server, I could just log in to my work machine. Politicians need to do better
        Going from database BACK to Trello board is painful, though, because of API limits.
        Washington hasn't been "obsessed" with punishing leaks; rather: it's been 10 years of anomalously egregious leaks.
        It's not obsession when prosecutors pay attention to leaks of entire databases of state secrets to randos on the Internet.
        It's not obsession when the leaker is passing North Korean counterproliferation intelligence to Fox News.
        It's not obsession when field agents and active projects are disclosed to reporters in order to market a book.
        And, harmful as this will be to my mentions, it's not obsession when you leak tens of thousands of NSA secrets to reporters... 
        ...  only a small percentage of which can actually be reported, the rest of which has to be protected in a SCIF managed by private citizens.
        You can disagree with any or all of these cases. I do, too! But it's been a freaky weird 10 years for leaks; no getting around it.

        Peel 9-15 heads of garlic, filling sauce pot 1/3. Just barely cover with olive oil. Simmer, LOWEST POSSIBLE TEMP, 30-40m until fork smushes.
        Strain off and reserve intense garlic oil, then mash roasted garlic with a fork and, I don't know, eat it or do something with it.
        I don't know why I didn't start following EXACTLY THESE STEPS with garlic until this year, but: has changed my life.
        Bread dough. Mushroom duxelles. Pickled onions. Roasted garlic. Caramelized onions.
