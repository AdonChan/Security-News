        OpenSSL security advisory, including yet another CBC padding oracle
        The patch for the new OpenSSL CBC padding oracle (CVE-2016-2107) is apparently one line. Looks easy to trigger.https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/70428eada9bc4cf31424d723d1f992baffeb0dfb ... 
        Since http://openssl.org  is obviously down, here's a Gist mirror of the Security Advisory https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/99ad6b52688f5a1f0a5fa2009a891490 ... 
        The vulnerable function has ifdef three levels deep, including many "# if 1" and does both encryption and decryptionhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/70428eada9bc4cf31424d723d1f992baffeb0dfb/crypto/evp/e_aes_cbc_hmac_sha1.c#L458 ... 
        Here's a preliminary analysis of the OpenSSL CBC padding oracle... building a test shouldn't be hard. ;-) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11621038 ... 
        OpenSSL vulnerability impact, AFAICT: if a TLS connection uses AES-CBC (and the server has AES-NI), a MitM can decrypt at least 16 bytes.

        Welp, it only took 3 PRs for me to get a sed one-liner correct today
        Someone planted fake evidence that Wright was Satoshi last year and then he actually is Satoshi OH COME ON JOURNALISM NO
        Still bewildered by the utter lack of critical analysis involved in most of the first round of stories on this
        Sudden awful realisation that I'm arriving in London in time for the mayoral election
        Ugh. The Open Whisper CLA (https://whispersystems.org/cla/ ) has exactly the same problem as the Canonical one:  http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/29160.html 
        The justification for the CLA makes no mention of this - just "clarity" and "protection". The asymmetric right to relicense is unjustified.
        Requiring contributors to allow the project owner to use code in proprietary works without having the same freedom themselves is a Bad Thing
        For added fun, the Open Whisper CLA appears to be specific to them - it's not one that's been independently studied or discussed.
        Don't write your own license, because nobody will understand what they mean. Don't write your own CLAs, for exactly the same reason.

        It's inevitable that, because of these sorts of issues, autonomous vehicles will have fairly strict geofenced areas where they're "allowed"
        Which will be just fine and dandy for urban and suburban areas - and interurban corridors - but not outside 'em.
        So..what kind of effect will this have on people growing up with such relatively constrained travel capabilities?
