+         .@comgenKDT @hacks4pancakes Seems they -really- want to lock people down
+  into only using their ecosystem, eh.
+         Ah. I think I've -just- comprehended a large part of MS's EEE policy for
+  linux this generation.
+         Step 1 was to get OSS community trust via open-sourcing .net, powershell
+ , etc.
+         Step 2 is integrating linux as a subsidiary system running underneath th
+ e windows kernel.
+         ...the scenes so long's you can run your webservers and containers and w
+ hatnot?
+         Step 3 is to continue the lockdown of available hardware to require wind
+ ows proprietary things if you want to use said hardware.
+         That way, linux becomes just another app under windows, and MS de-facto
+ controls the whole ecosystem.
+         Embrace [ to get talent away from alternatives ]
+         And now MS is able to capture a large and expanding market segment that
+ they'd not otherwise be able to control.
+         's a good strategy. Prolly also see a lot of folks saying "But you don't
+  need to install linux on bare metal; you've got all the same stuff"
+         And other various propaganda in favor of the 'nix subsystem being 'good
+ enough for you developers'
+         Good perspective by @mjg59 here - though I'm not entirely sold on it not
+  being mostly MS's fault.https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/778642649326596096 ...
