        The path to hell is paved with great ideas for home brew encryption.
        . @JZdziarski no device complying with Feinstein-Burr bill could be used according to most of the minimum DoD/NSA/etc security requirements.
        If Apple wants to stop this encryption bill in its tracks, they should refuse to sell special "non-backdoored" products to the US gov/mil.
        Historically, only reason bans have works is because gov/mil has been able to get weapons they ban citizens from having. Apple can refuse.

        I was at the GWB Presidential Library, walking with kids learning about 9/11. They hadnt been born yet. I couldnt stop watching their faces.
        They were short so they spent the whole time looking up. Looking up at the towers on fire. Witnessing it, in some ways, for the first time.
        And then I remembered. Sitting on the floor. Watching the images on the TV play over and over. In them, I saw me. And I wanted to cry.
        So I looked away.
        That was the first time I grasped what history was. What it meant. And why people say they see the future in the faces of their children.
        Thanks for listening to me. I didn't cry then. But I'm crying now.

        A long time ago there was a project call OpenMath where we were working on passing #compalg data between different CA software with meaning... 
        we built bindings for REDUCE, Maple, Mathematica supplied them and we passed a computation, not just data, between REDUCE and Mathematica.
        The CSL/REDUCE bindings were mine and I remember the project fondly as it was also a window into the world of EU "standards" :D
        but it was quite something to see a computation start in REDUCE, hop over to Mathematica and come back to REDUCE in the late 90s.
