        Stop using bashisms in your shell scripts and gcc hacks in your C code.

        For years, I knew how little load average means. Once wrote a program to fake LA to illustrate. But exactly 0.00 under load unintentionally?
        The Internet of Things' is short for 'The Internet of Things you don't need'

        THE GOD'S EYE VIEW by Barry Eisler http://wp.me/p6kbaM-6a  via @TheNovelBlog
        Disturbing @radleybalko piece on how NSA surveillance data now being used for routine policing (shocker, right?)
        If only someone could've warned that the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
        With few exceptions, Obama administration has far exceeded Bush-era assault on civil liberties. Yet the left remains largely silent.

        We have B. Watson, R. Stortz & S. Apelt doing their dry-run for @InfiltrateCon today
        After the Snowden leaks, the main assurance we were given was that this capability would never be used against us. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/03/10/surprise-nsa-data-will-soon-routinely-be-used-for-domestic-policing-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-terrorism/ ... 
        This INFILTRATE dry run on Android browser security is making me want to switch to the iPhone.
        What if, hear me out, dog shows, but for women.
        Is there a better mobile browser usage list than here: http://caniuse.com/usage-table  ?
        There's close to nothing accurate in this blog post, @ErrataRob. Sorry, but this is getting frustrating to correct. http://blog.erratasec.com/2016/03/can-apple-code-be-misused.html ... 
        Most common INFILTRATE dry run feedback: PLEASE USE ZOOMIE ZOOMS on small diagrams and text! I always propose Prezi, because it is awesome.
        Likewise, text contrast is a big issue - most people write their presentations without ever looking at them on a projector.
        "Reversing Haskell is a ring of Hell that Dante didn't quite describe" - one of the INFILTRATE dry runs.
        This INFILTRATE talk answers the question about what it's like to reverse engineer a whole new language (SWIFT in this case).
        "Calling conventions: Swift's approach: YOLO" <-- I laughed out loud at parts of this talk.
        Basically modern languages just steal some random subset of Java's features, it looks like. SWIFT is no exception. Except the emojis.
        @dinodaizovi you need to slam a kale smoothie and get your thinkfluence game on track bruh
        This is important. Failing to reach 1,237 delegates by California does not necessarily equal contested convention. https://twitter.com/jbview/status/708374332079284224 ... 
        One thing we invest in at INFILTRATE is extra bartenders for the open bars - we hate lines as much as you do!
        Modest proposal: we use @Immunityinc's NOP exam or an equivalent to determine who actually knows how exploits work. Can't pass it? STFU.
        Because the NOP is honestly the "hello world" of exploits. If you can't even write a "hello world" on demand, you can't say you can code.

        For years, I knew how little load average means. Once wrote a program to fake LA to illustrate. But exactly 0.00 under load unintentionally?
        @solardiz I can produce the opposite: exactly 1.0 (or any integer) under complete idle. :-)
