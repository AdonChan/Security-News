        Thinking about where the Google bounties for Android bugs should go? 
        gcc treats **a and a[0][0] differently. It's user-visible in the case of type-punning with a 2d array in a union -- https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70166 ... 
        So, I think I finally need to dump thttpd. It does the awful ".gz is a transfer encoding" thing. :-(
        Now I need to find the ideal modern light http+s setup.
        This is basically how I view C and C++, respectively.pic.twitter.com/vZpshShIFF

        The experts of garrulous code comments don't actually understand what they're railing against? Say it isn't so!https://twitter.com/paxteam/status/710609834022977538 ... 
        Had to do actual useful work today so a full response will come later, but suffice to say there's nothing to "fix" in PaX's ASLR
        Presentation's full of ridiculous inaccuracies and flawed data -- comparing 32-bit PaX ASLR in some cases with 64-bit "ASLR-NG" results...
        Enabling UDEREF in the PaX case for comparisons when it's documented that it reduces the userland address space and thus entropy count
        Making no mention whatsoever of grsec's anti-bruteforcing which makes any talk of entropy count useless
        Claiming PaX's PIE randomization is lower than vanilla -- simply not true (they probably compared 32-bit PaX to 64-bit vanilla)
        Shows PaX 32-bit results in a graph with a 2GB userland address space as if PaX imposes that limitation, compares to 3GB address space
        Claims largest mmap allowed by PaX on 32-bit is 692MB, simply not true, anyone can write a trivial test to verify it.
        Every one of the inaccuracies in their paper could have been corrected if they contacted us, which they didn't
        I guess they knew if all the lies in the silly presentation were fixed, there'd be nothing to present
        BTW: the BH presenters are the same academics whose attention to detail led to them spamming vuln notices to multiple mailing lists (1/2)
        talking about how PaX ASLR entropy counts are no better than vanilla, coming from a kernel config with PaX completely disabled! (2/2)
