        "Damn, I sure wish this phone didn't have a headphone jack",  said nobody.
        I'm not sure I understand why 3.5mm jacks can't be part of a water resistant device, given that many IP67 & IP68 devices have them.
        And now I get to hear from people telling my why I should be more grateful for the wise removal of the headphone jack.
        Before you say "but this way is digital", think for a moment about what headphones do and how they work.
        Now that there's an app to tell me to breathe I can finally get rid of my old fashioned autonomic nervous system.

        BART riders can delight in knowing that the new iPhone speakers are twice as loud
        oh cool, 2x the iPhone speaker volume, so people watching stupid videos at restaurants can be even more annoying

        "Better all of us" where us means the people at Apple who want to bring back the DRM.  The fanboys will cheer anyway, because Apple.
        Apple has apparently redefined 'courage' to mean 'forcing you into buying expensive add-ons to increase their profit margin'
        Thus meaning even more additional expense were I to attempt to convert to their domain.

        Some of my greatest intellectual achievements have consisted of understanding what small children are trying to say.
        "What is a police officer and a cop?" asked my 4 yo. After about a minute of (his) increasing impatience, I realized he meant a synonym.
        "He's boring," my 4 yo seemed to say as he ate ice cream with a long spoon. Finally I understood he meant it was like an aborted landing.
        Thanks to Lego my 4 yo calls this a "robber hat" & thinks wearing one is necessary and sufficient for being a crook.pic.twitter.com/Wr64pYC2UK
