        I think admitting ignorance about a topic is not a sin. And admitting that one relies on Google to obtain information isn't either.
        You could expect a presidential candidate to have thought about Aleppo beforehand, but "I'll google it" is a better answer than Trumps :)
        Lastly, I don't think the question "what can be done about Aleppo" or the crisis in Syria even has a simple answer. But I don't know.

        Seems some hackers are already looking forward to AirPods and hacking the wireless protocol for remote listening.
        I don't really care what connector my headphones have but not being able to charge and listen to music via lightning at same time is idiotic
        Luckily iOS 10 does not deprecate support of wireless bluetooth headphones. That is the courageous move planned for iOS 11.
        @i0n1c think about it bluetooth is like what 25 years old now. we gotta move on :P
        Looks like iPhone 7 (plus) got again more expensive (because you cannot buy 64 GB anymore)

        No new security architecture changes announced in the iPhone 7, correct?
        Fortunately, I'm long on popcorn futures.https://twitter.com/riskybusiness/status/773656152504606720 ... 

        My prediction is that the discovery process will do at least as much damage to St. Jude in this lawsuit as the original report.
        If their claim is that the reported vulnerabilities aren't actually vulnerabilities, that's going to get a LOT of scrutiny at trial.
        Worse, claiming the vulnerabilities are false puts St. Jude (and its customers) in the positon of being dis-incented from fixing them.
        Any even remotely security-related changes St. Jude makes to its product will now look like an admission. I'd not want to be a customer.
        The biggest problem with the St. Jude / MedSec situation.
        FTR, I find MedSec's business model rather distasteful. But I'm more disturbed by St. Jude's assertion of a duty to "coordinate" disclosure.
        There are valid reasons the discoverer of a vulnerability might not coordinate with a vendor. It's a case-by-case issue. No one rule here.
        And, FTR, I have no idea how serious the claimed vulnerabilities in St. Jude's products are.
        1) No DMCA, CFAA or trade secret claims. This seems to limit the potential impact of an adverse ruling on most security research
        2) Raj De (ex-GC of NSA) is the senior partner for St. Jude. Met him once, very impressive, definitely has the tech chops to go hard.
        Makes me wonder if lack of controversial claims is strategic decision to keep security community (and a dozen pro bono experts) on sidelines
        Bracing as 15th anniversary of 9/11 inevitably co-opted to suit political narratives. That day is still just a sad, deep scar for me.
        So when I hear stuff that starts "As 9/11 proved..." you've probably lost me before the sentence ends.
        Of course, there certainly were 9/11 lessons learned, about community, emergency response, etc. But those folks don't invoke 9/11 casually.
