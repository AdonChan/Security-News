        Perhaps fab-less CPU production (design and fab in different countries) is the only way to get trustworthy processors? #ThinkingOutLoud
        Needless to say that would only be a required, not a sufficient condition. Still, ability to verify the "processor binaries" might be huge?
        E.g.: others-than-Intel-and-USG could easily see (& control even) what's on that inside-the-processor-ROM as used by  #IntelME?
