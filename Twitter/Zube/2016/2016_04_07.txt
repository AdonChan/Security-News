        Ladies and gentlemen @Swisscom_B2B_en has just called and they want 150 francs/mth for an #IPv6 subnet extra! /cc @tweetsix
        So let me explain this better, @Swisscom_B2B_en claims that to get an #IPv6 /64, the most basic #IPv6 allocation, they want 150 francs/mth... 
        Dear @ip_max, I think Swisscom have just managed to make complete fools of themselves...  #CallYourISPforIPv6https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/717342335282110464 ... 
        @cynicalsecurity they could have at least told "ipv6 is almost depleted, and that's why it costs much"
        "There will always be a Belgium"
        So, you call your contact and discover @Swisscom_B2B_en truly are clueless: if you have a CHF10/mth fixed IP you get a fix /48 *free*. #fail
        The genius at @Swisscom_B2B_en who called me:
        Finally, dear @Swisscom_B2B_en, it is already enabled: all fixed IP users need is to run DHCPv6-DP to get their allocation.
        now what if there's a hisev bug in the Signal Protocol code? anyone taking a bet? @matthew_d_green @tqbf @marver @hanno
        Hey @ip_max, I am on SIG fibre, can you please help me replace the incompetence at @Swisscom_B2B_en?

        Great WhatsApp is doing end-to-end crypto; that's important for security. But protecting (& deleting) chat logs at least equally important.
        The threat isn't just government eavesdroppers, it's the criminal (or whoever) who gets hold of your handset & reads all your old messages.
        Not to throw too much cold water here - genuine kudos to WhatsApp. But end-to-end crypto is mostly the easy part.
        This is why allowing vendors to harden handsets against attack is so important. We lose handsets with sensitive info all the time.

        I've been around Debian to various degrees for over 15 years, and the dynamics are still confusing to me
        Debian's release policies do create real work for upstream maintainers. Refusing to make allowances around that isn't good social behaviour.
        MISST DICH MIT DER SPITZENKLASSE,
        I had some thoughts on how Debian should be using the XScreenSaver argument as a teachable moment http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/41085.html 
        The strangest thing about writing http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/41085.html  is that I almost understand where JÃ¶rg Schilling was coming from now

        Whatever ESR might believe, any fight isn't over an individual conference. It's over commitment to CoCs, to diversity, to wider community.

        This leak is a direct result of bad security practices by a law firm.

        SERIOUSLY THAT DUDE IS LIKE THE LEAST FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMER OF ALL TIME
        My problem w/ Lambda's organizers isn't racism (I don't see evidence they are), it's tech chauvinism.
        I have a visceral negative reaction to closing ranks around objectionable people because they're somehow part of the tribe.
        That line of thinking brings us to "win a debate against racism, from first principles, on a message board, or else racism isn't a thing".
