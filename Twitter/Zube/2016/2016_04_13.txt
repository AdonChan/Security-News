        Given how much we increasingly let software control, developing proper security audits is essential. Especially for elections.
        If you have any access to code, it's really not that hard to quietly rig the whole thing. It's really hard to discover it.

        Question for pentesters/commercial incident responders: How often do attackers make changes to AD in the real world? Or is it mostly pivot?

        Public Service Announcement: Make sure your IT department isn't deploying Windows 10 LTSB.
        Microsoft communication with business customers tastes how using Linux feels.
        "Windows 10 Long Term Servicing" is for embedded/regulated industries. For some reason they renamed it because that's how Microsoft gets off
        CORRECTION: Microsoft Office changed the name of its Current Branch for Business to "Deferred." Not Windows. I apologize for the error.

        If you celebrate your marriage in a european country you're not resident in, getting visas for non-EU guests can be pretty nightmarish.
        Example from France: The person that invites is supposed to get a letter signed from his local town hall. Assumes you're a french resident.
        It's funny how the west is all about "human rights", but really doesn't like freedom of movement - because it would be very costly to us.

        If you think big banks are good, then make that case. Don't just shoot at people who want to break them up. Make the case for your ideas.
        What exactly is the point of having globe straddling multi-trillion dollar financial institutions? What purpose do they serve?
        Those who think TBTF banks are destabilizing also tend to think that smaller banks serve the public better.
        Are there returns to scale at the $500B+ balance sheet level? Do they provide some otherwise un-providable service? What is the point?
        "I'm no defender of the big banks but.." then either (a) stop defending them or (b) retract that and just make the case for big banks.

        "A lot of that came from the South."
        Black voters in the South are the reason Dems can win Virginia and Florida, and stay competitive in North Carolina and Florida.
        Blacks generally are the reason liberals, in particular, can win national elections. Remove blacks & electoral scope of liberalism shrinks.
        Easy to forget that seriously contesting NC, even if you lose it, forces the GOP to spend to retain it; money not spent on OH, FL, PA.

        Accepting a white supremacist speaker at your tech conference, and refusing to rescind, does not make you a white supremacist or an enabler.
        But making a big show of accepting a white supremacist to your conf makes it very hard to sympathize when the market reacts predictably.
        And being showily associated with a white supremacist is a tricky position to be in; mistakes pile on top of mistakes, get harder to avoid.
