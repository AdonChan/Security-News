        If history has thought us anything, it's that we fail at securing authentication-less services like MongoDB. http://www.databreaches.net/personal-info-of-93-4-million-mexicans-exposed-on-amazon/ ... 
        This has been happening with Memcached instances worldwide too, yet nobody bothers fixing that.
        A simple firewall isn't a complex thing, yet at the same time more & more data breaches happen because of these open services.

        "passwords...were encrypted"
        No, hashing and encryption are not interchangeable.
        A hash is a one-way function intended to reduce a set of data to a unique fixed-length fingerprint.
        Encryption is intended for two-way function: encrypting to random-looking data, then decrypting back from it.
        We use hashes for passwords for several reasons. One of them is so that password length doesn't matter.
        Since all hashes of a given type are the same length, you can't tell how long a password is.
        Another reason is because it's much harder to brute-force a hash than try to decrypt a password. Each hash must be done individually.
        If you encrypt passwords, once you figure out one of them, you know the key for all of them.

        Wow. I'm going backwards from 1980 now and in 1976 the GOP is like an entirely different party.
        The 1976 GOP platform calls to end over-classification of government records.
        OTOH, in 1976 the GOP wanted a constitutional amendment allowing local gov'ts to require "nonsectarian" school prayer.
        "The question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time. It is undoubtedly a moral and personal issue" '76 GOP
        By 1972 the GOP platform is so reasonable that it's incredibly boring to read.
        So first observation is: if you want to talk about Republicanism as descriptive of a particular ideology, you have to start at 1980.
        To say someone (mainstream) would fit in with the Republican party of 1976 or 1972 is to say almost nothing at all.
        Linux crypto randomness discussion decoder ring: "information-theoretically secure" = "generates a one-time pad".
        Another observation from reading 1980-2012 GOP platforms: there isn't even an alternate universe in which HRC is a "moderate Republican".
        The '80, '84, '88, '92, '96, '00, '04, '08, '12 GOP platform, distilled (keeping only things that are consistent): https://gist.github.com/tqbf/a7a9d53a2947b0967838586f6258ac9c ...
