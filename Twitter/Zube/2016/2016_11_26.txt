        @SwiftOnSecurity thanks to your holiday guide, I repaired my mom's work(sigh) computer that was filled with adware and junk. Thank you! <3
        .@arjundot This is the best feedback I get, I just do this to know I'm helping people. Thank you for telling me that.  
        I wish I could get bitten by a radioactive confident person.
        "@damiranz: DonaldTrump: Pls don't run for president. If you do and win, the rest of the world would be screwed" So true, (except friends)!
        NOTE: Chrome slowness often misbehaving antivirus. Use 64bit version which is better protected against interference. https://enterprise.google.com/chrome/chrome-browser/ ... 
        Chrome is pretty hardcore about stopping stuff from messing with it, so antivirus uses dirty tricks to try to "help" and just screws it up.
        Let me tell you, get Chrome developers in a group chat and they have some interesting things to say about security software breaking stuff..
        @SwiftOnSecurity yup. we had a couple of crash bugs in the past because antivirus would patch jit code or lib. memcpy in one instance.
        Chrome is constantly coding in new protection mechanisms and changes, any attempts to hook in and "enhance" it is a very risky idea.
        Microsoft Edge is similar, very isolated. So much of what made Internet Explorer a dragging nightmare was 3rd-party hooks trying to "help."
        @riskybusiness @evacide The backlash against SMS 2FA is a great example of security nihilism. "Not secure against GRU/MSS, so it's useless!"
        @riskybusiness @evacide There are definitely people who have a threat model incompatible with SMS 2FA, but almost nobody tweeting about it.
        @riskybusiness @evacide And the nihilism filters down from the security elite into bad reporting, which hurts people who could benefit.
        @riskybusiness @evacide Super-secure options should exist, but if 50% of users had SMS-only auth right now entire fraud industries go poof
        @riskybusiness @evacide Comes down to ruining economics of attacks against the 99% while giving good choices and education to targeted 1%

        Interesting how the new vuln's id is CESA-2016-0011, jumping up from CESA-2016-0004: are we to see more 0-day soon? Can't wait!https://twitter.com/scarybeasts/status/802058489153482752 ... 
        #DailyBug #MSIE 10 CEditAdorner::Detach use-after-free
        Anybody have 10+ years of data on # of public 0-day drops, # of vendors with bug bounties, # of 0-day found in malware? (1/2)
        Bug bounties and malware revenue offer financial incentive not to drop 0-day, so these must be correlated. I'd like to visualize that (2/2)
        (obviously there are other factors which may have a large effect as well, so this is not going to be an exhaustive scientific study).

        @mattblaze  CS profs have shown e-voting easily hackable, e.g. @verifiedvoting since 2003. Why is it reported like a conspiracy theory?
        Sure, we all have plenty to complain about. But I'm extremely grateful for the good friends who have become an extended family to me.
        Hey, you folks asking why I'm "just talking about voting insecurity now and said nothing in 2008 or 2012" might want to check your facts.
        Sure, I'll work hard responding to your wild assertions about my views. Don't bother reading any of the stuff I've written  on the topic.
        It's not like me or JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER E-VOTING SECURITY RESEARCHER have been talking about this nonstop for 15+ years now or anything.
        Um, this is just plain security, not "cyber" security.pic.twitter.com/X2dwPcoKBv

        We're on to talking about commentary on Marx so I think I've made good life choices
        This Thanksgiving give thanks to those who ensured you had weekends and a 40 hour work week and think how you can protect those things
        Definitely enjoying the way that clicking on "Join the queue" on the #33c3 ticket website just gives me the same page again

        Russian propaganda effort helped spread 'fake news' during election, experts sayhttp://wapo.st/2fKGC71 
        Would Trump have won without Russia's help? Is there a consensus yet?
        Three stages of design: 
        In bureaucratic organizations, internal resistance prevents you from moving from step 2 to step 3.
        So consistently in fact that this would make a good test of whether an organization is too bureaucratic: Can anything ever get simpler?
        Imagine a stored-value card so thin it could be folded, and that could be accepted with zero hardware. The catch: the value is fixed.
        So it has to be surrendered on the first use. You can however get similar cards with smaller fixed values in return.
        Whether Russia tipped the election or not, it's interesting to realize social media offers a way to influence other countries' elections.
        Eliminating fake news is a matter of national security, not just an administrative problem for Facebook.
