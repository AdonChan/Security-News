        @JeffBush01 A few years later, we had a problem, so we signed a build that had a backdoor allowing installing software without a prod cert.

        Just think -- right now Rupert Murdoch could be flaccidly trying to grunt his putrid love truncheon into Jerry Hall.
        "Oh Rupey, you liver-spotted sex walnut! Do it to me like you haven't been capable of doing for a good twenty years. Is it in yet?"
        Murdoch's buttocks flounced around like two warty slapheads in a typhoon, but it was no use - Rupert Jr was refusing to co-operate.
        Horrifyingly, Colourbox's debut album was released 31 years ago. Reassuringly, 'Arena' is still as good a song now as it was in 1985.
        There are two great Colourbox compilations on iTunes - standout tracks: Just Give 'Em Whiskey, Arena II, Baby I Love You So (12" Version).
        Also: Edit the Dragon, The Official Colourbox World Cup Theme (7" Version), Looks Like We're Shy One Horse/Shoot Out, Hipnition, Punch.
        There are few things in life that bring home to me how old I am than the age of albums I still listen to.
        Perhaps we've got it all wrong. Perhaps Rupert is a virile eight inch silly string firing sex brute who can satisfy women like no other man.
        I mean, he's a rich man -- he might have two cocks and dildos for fingers. His lizard tongue might do unimaginable things to a G-spot.
        Tweets are like farts, really. You let one out into the world and wait to see if you get a reaction, and often your best ones go ignored.
        Rupert summoned a footman to light his post-coital cigarette. Jerry lay on the bed, panting, a light film of perspiration covering her soul.
        If you want someone who's good at lighting a fire, call a cinematographer.

        My issues with Nadim Kobeissi have surprisingly little to do with the extremely poor quality of CryptoCat, and are (sry) not your business.
        Nadim would like very much -- as he has repeatedly indicated in his emailed apologies -- for me to explain. I do not owe him that.
        In case this matters: the first time Nadim mailed me, I warned him clearly and plainly that none of his mails to me would be kept private.
        @shazow @rhymebyter @tqbf pretty sure his main crime is coding while brown.
        Nasty person I block on Twitter demands I leave him alone: https://nadim.computer/2016/03/05/thomas-ptacek.html ... 
        Some additional context: https://www.dropbox.com/s/us7wnvmrgoyx5i0/Screenshot%202016-03-05%2008.13.55.png?dl=0 ... 
        Nadim is lying, but I feel satisfied letting him twist like this. I have no plans to explain, to him or really anyone else.
        Just to be clear: none of this has anything to do with USENIX; the INRIA team submitted a paper both me and my co-chair shortlisted.
        I agree with the consensus that the INRIA paper was the best of that conference. I reviewed papers, not people, and am done w/ USENIX now.
        My review of Nadim as a person: ZERO STARS.
        FWIW: The joke was about PKCS12. Because it's funny, I'll relate it.
        A conversation on HN about Ed25519 occurs, where someone points out there are grossly insecure versions of Ed25519.
        That's interesting! Ed25519 was designed to be hard to implement insecurely. Turns out: people manage it anyways.
        So on crypto dork slack, someone says: "stuff like this is why every time I write crypto, I put 'don't use this' comments in it"
        And I'm like, yeah, any time I ever write crypto code I do that, because I don't want to be made fun of later.
        BUT DESPITE THAT, I said, I did write dont-use-this crypto code that every 6 months someone mails me becdause they want to use.
        That code: a Golang RC2 impl. "RC2?!#$" crypto slack says, aghast. "Why on earth would you write RC2".
        And I say: because there is a horrible certificate format that requires RC2, which is true.
        And so we arrive at The Snarky Crypto Tweet Heard 'Round The Twittersphere. Glad to bring you all up to date.
