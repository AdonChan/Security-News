        Oh wait, macOS KPI does support MD5.
        Looks like sha1 is more suited for file hashing than md5. Thanks for the feedbacks.

        I genuinely feel bad about the situation YC is in. But there's a clear moral and practical answer. 
        @Pinboard we never funded gab. never a YC company.
        Weird argument on working for Trump's NSA. "Work there to prevent the abuses that I also argue can never happen." https://lawfareblog.com/duty-serve-trumps-america ... 
        @Pinboard first part of argument was tested by the Israeli left. Guess what? Found out a single voice can't change an oppressive room.
        Also weird to look back on this one:https://twitter.com/lifewinning/status/778728396499013634 ... 
        "Mr. Trump...  is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the White House." Huge AirBnB opportunity!
        I bet "Hillary and Bill Smith" would pay good money for a few weekends at the White House, whenever Trump wants to stay home
        People who think the government already has all their personal data grossly underestimate how much behavioral data is  being collected.
        There isn't a government copy of Google, Amazon and Facebook out there. That's why those companies can protect users by purging data
        Would you rather be able to say "I don't have any location data stored for my Muslim users", or go to jail for refusing a subpoena?
        Google ads (seriously) thinks I'm an Arabic-speaking woman interested in sausages and Cleveland, so I have a personal stake in this!
        If you work at one of these big companies, think about your own ethical red lines now, and decide in advance what to do if they're crossed
        Zuckerberg has said that Facebook has no ability to influence anyone, so they can just get rid of all behavioral data and show ads at random
        @Pinboard Google thinks I'm Colombia. Am Ametican brown dude. These idiots collect data, but have no idea how to interpret it.

        Ted Cruz is being considered for the Supreme Court, probably because his colleagues figure it's the quickest way to get rid of him.
        Having Ted Cruz on the Supreme Court would turn into an Agatha Christie mystery, where eight Justices try themselves to see who killed him
        New Secret Service motto: "Keep nope alive"
        @baconmeteor The twist is Justice Sotomayor uses a hand gun.

        Excited to see what happens in January when Trump nominates Ivanka to the Supreme Court
        Trump will require Secret Service agents protecting the President to wear that gold body paint from Goldfinger
        You can't tell me you're not a little curious to find out what they're picking for Trump's Secret Service code name
        @baconmeteor you just said it. Goldfinger

        I worked for Congress for 6 years, and here's what I learned about how they listen to constituents.
        First, tweeting or writing on Facebook is largely ineffective. I never looked at those comments except to remove the harassing ones.
        Second, writing a letter to the district office (state) is better than sending an email or writing a letter to DC.
        But, the most effective thing is to actually call them on the phone. At their district (state) office. They have to talk to you there.
        We repped half a million people, it was impossible to read and respond personally to all letters. Impossible.
        This was something in particular that I cared about as a staffer and worked very hard on, but the sheer volume of emails is overwhelming
        Here's a Storify of my thread if you'd like to share:https://storify.com/editoremilye/i-worked-for-congress-for-six-years ...

        Interesting afternoon at @theNASEM #crypto study meeting today. Thanks to everyone who stayed awake for my talk.
        Good evening fine Philadelphians! Approx 250 have gathered in Center City.Expect delays if U are out and about in town tonight. #FridayNight
        Horrified and sickened by the loathsome - and cowardly - racist abuse of @penn students today. This will not stand. Not in my community.
        Whoever did this - and those who emboldened them to do it - should know that our community is united against your vile ideas.

        Does Trump not understand that this is kind of a full time job he signed up for?
        Every president spends time away from the WH. But if Trump thinks he's going to have weekends off, I suspect he's in for a rude awakening.
        I almost actually feel sorry for the guy, sort of. Being president must be miserably hard drudgery if you don't really want the job.

        Note that I don't know anything more than was in the statement I just posted.
        Hint: it's extremely unlikely that I'll recognize your authority to tell me what topics I can and can't post about.
        Remember, as bad as Trump might be, it's OK because Clinton is REALLY BAD at email.
        Has any sitting president used an urban apartment building (with other tenants) as their alt residence? Sounds like a security nightmare.
        How are they going to screen all the tenants and businesses in the building? And will 5th ave be closed to traffic when he's there?
        If I lived or worked in that building- or anywhere in that neighborhood- I'd be seriously annoyed. Traffic nightmares even by NYC standards.
        "I'll just live in my NYC apartment" thing suggests Trump is not just bad at policy, but also basic, day-to-day stuff (most of the job).
        I like NY, too, and you can get much better late night take out there than in DC, but I think his new job requires some sacrifices.
        To all public officials that are faced with a Trump presidency they disagree with: Do the best service to the US and the constitution ...
        ... but it may be a good idea to write down the lines that should not be crossed *now*, before boiling frog syndrome sets in.

        Can Trump Save Their Jobs? They're Counting on Ithttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/business/economy/can-trump-save-their-jobs-theyre-counting-on-it.html ... 
        The Democrats party is splitting into populists and rump Clintonistas. Or anti-monopolists versus 'it's not my faulters'.
        The most important thing that Democratic leaders can do is explain why none of this is their fault.
        It's critical that in the wake of what happened our cultural, economic, and political leaders admit no errors and blame other people.
        Avoiding mentioning the warnings received over the years about rising anger and frustration is essential to avoid blame.
        Another key tactic for the not-my-faulters in this moment is to talk up technology and globalization as impersonal irresistible forces.
        It is also important to pretend like every Clinton voter was 100% super happy with her/her choice. Because they were!
        It is important to address the core concern that angry voters have, which is whether they can get Hamilton tickets. Hamilton was so good!
        Another key strategy is to misrepresent the views of critics. Critics are all Luddites who hate other countries.https://twitter.com/joe_atikian/status/797464946049253376 ... 
        This is what Americans want to hear: Not my fault! Congrats on a perfect talking point.https://twitter.com/nateisgood/status/797464776695656448 ... 
        More great work. I'm so inspired at how so creative people are at finding others to blame.https://twitter.com/DMansini/status/797463550549753856 ... 
        And well all else fails, assign homework to your critics. Awesome job. I couldn't be prouder.https://twitter.com/nateisgood/status/797467162906480640 ... 
        I'm so embarrassed! How could I have forgotten this one?https://twitter.com/yashalevine/status/797467392670572544 ... 
        @matthewstoller Also have former Obama campaign managers who left to lobby for Silicon Valley write NYT op-eds avoiding economic corporatism
        I'm just so proud at the explosion of creativity in excuses from the not-my-faulters. Gonna take a walk and listen to Hamilton now. So good!
