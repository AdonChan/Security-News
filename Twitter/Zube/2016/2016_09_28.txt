        Got feedback from our blackhat talk.  My favorite was this "Getting to smarmy....tone the "act" down please."  Shockinlgly people like it.
        I beat @nudehaberdasher once again on speaker rating, 3.83 vs 3.79 (out of 4).  I guess those 5 extra years of school are paying off!

        The Programmers' Credo: we do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy
        "The standard library saves programmers from having to reinvent the wheel." - Bjarne Stroustrup

DennisThePerrin

        Trump is the "chaos maker," which makes Hillary the rational war criminal. #debatenight #CNN
        Hillary: "The more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be. I don't agree with that." Goldman Sachs debate party erupts in laughter
        If you doubt the confluence of the corporate parties, note that Trump is wearing blue, and Hillary red. #debatenight
        "I think that the wealthy and corporations should pay their fair share. They've certainly done that for me and Bill." #debatenight
        At this point, Trump may as well launch into his Rip Taylor tribute. #debatenightpic.twitter.com/ig4zZZUNfw
        Love it when Hillary lectures us about the racial divide, given the paradise she and Bill created for people of color. #debatenight
        "Law and order," Nixon's phrase for attacking Black people. Tricky Trump. #debatenight
        Why don't they talk about structural racism and oppression? Oh right, they're running for president. #debatenight
        Why doesn't Hillary mention that it was her husband who helped expand the prison population? Oh, yeah. #debatenight
        "If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun." Lincolnesque. #debatenight
        "When you act holier than thou, it really doesn't work." Yes it does, Donald. It works all too well. #debatenight
        The US is the passive victim of cyber attacks. The poor, weak NSA will need more money. #debatenight
        When Hillary talks about Iraq and Syria, get ready for lots of death. #debatenight
        NATO predated and danced on the Warsaw Pact's grave. So what is its purpose today? Oh, yes . . . #debatenight
        All Hillary has to do at this point is stand still and smile condescendingly. #debatenight
        Hillary has been bellicose on Iran. She takes pride in it, and I don't think she's ever been comfortable with the Iran deal. #debatenight
        Imperial states don't have words that are good. They have policies to ensure the expansion of their power. #debatenight
        Hillary was better prepared and much steadier than Trump. And her militarist goals are much more realistic. Think about that. #debatenight
        Tonight you saw why US elites across the spectrum support Hillary. She's the more reliable corporatist. #debatenight
        Liberals hate wild declarations until it's their turn. "Trump's on coke!" If only. A boorish version of Terry Southern's Guy Grand. #Debates

        We pre-install and support IE, Chrome, and Firefox on all machines - so we are very risk-tolerant for innovating our browser configurations.

        Anyone out there got any good refs to SMAP & SMAP bypass related research? I'm not digging much up. Thanks!
        I realise how similar it is to SMEP, by the way. And there's plenty of stuff on that. Just wondering if there's any good examples.
        19:30 AEST tonight I'm live-streaming RE of capcom.sys, & the construction of Windows 7 LPE exploit & MSF module. I'll even submit the PR!

        Not only will I get Twitch to archive it, I will even record as much as I can locally as a fallback.

        Therapy experience: focused on ensuring that I feel happy and not pressing me on issues I didn't raise. Is this the same for other men?
        Tremendously useful in any case, but it feels like the base standard for male therapy is "Isn't crying, isn't an obvious sociopath"
        And further question: do women have different experiences here?

        Instead of providing a POC you could have easily done pseudocode or explain what libraries or methods ransomware uses.
        Well, we did want to be taken seriously on the national stage.
        So we'll be seeing a bunch more new 'compliance' standards and other red tape to muddle through, because that's what gov't does best.
        And I suppose we'll see some kind of half-cracked licensing scheme proposed, if nowt else.

        It is possible to fact-check, it's that simple. Anyone who argues otherwise is adopting a narrow, keyhole-sized worldview.

        Trump lies about not calling climate change a hoax invented by China http://bit.ly/2dnoxPQ  by @RobertMackey #debates
        By me: "Trump once hated big donors getting debate tickets -- now he's handing them out to Sheldon Adelson" #debateshttps://theintercept.com/liveblogs/firstdebate/trump-once-hated-big-donors-getting-debate-tickets-now-hes-handing-them-out-to-sheldon-adelson/ ... 
        Trump touts his military endorsements. Perhaps the best is the general who believes Jesus will return with an AR-15 https://theintercept.com/liveblogs/firstdebate/the-hard-partying-surfer-turned-master-assassin-who-is-trumps-guest-at-the-debate/ ... pic.twitter.com/S4ZCzntiXH
        Trump is horrendous at this & could be destroyed by anyone halfway competent. Clinton is not halfway competent. #debates

        I feel like Hillary got coached by Al Gore for this debate. She needed to be a devastating, tenacious bulldog, not amused NPR listener
        OK GOOD
        Single worst problem In the world: nuclear things and people who don't pay for them.
        hey i'm debating
        Make him define stamina!
        *fist pumps fist pumps*
        Trump brings up Rosie O'Donnell. Very presidential!
        neither one blew it
        That debate elevated Donald Trump.
        Now, for the opinion of the Kremlin.https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/780585219648880640 ... 
        I am going to choose to believe this is true and drink until I fall asleep.https://twitter.com/krmchugh/status/780600129409675264 ... 
        EXACTLY RIGHT.https://twitter.com/themadstone/status/780596507577765888 ... 
        We all learned a valuable lesson today: the 2016 Presidential Election run-up, race, punditry, and vote is Frog Fractions 2
        You'll die alone. There is no debate. 
        You are all tempting the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing.
        White dudes in Chicago claiming to hate him for what he said at the debate: really?
        Trump is a horrible person and a national disgrace but I'm not sure the Chicago Pride card plays here.
        I am not making a comment about Trump, but about white dudes who think Chicago is just great right now.
        Huh. Good point.https://twitter.com/ideasinfood/status/780831779028631552 ...
