        The longer I have to process what POTUS just did at SXSW, the more disappointed, sad, and angry I become. :(
        We have been seizing a moment when it is possible to get uniquely experienced technologists empowered to fix fundamental infrastructure. 1/n
        It's been hard to build credibility with, and interest from, the folks most suited to help make the huge info infra in government work. 2/n
        The fragile trust and belief in efforts like USDS, among technologists who have built or run infrastructure at scale, was damaged today. 3/n
        At a minimum, the president's message of recruitment and inspiration was irrecoverably diluted. It breaks my heart, because: 4/n
        I'm here, helping to fix that infrastructure. I know it is possible to fix, and that our country needs it to work. We need so much help. 5/5

        Now that pangu has released yet another jailbreak based on other people's work they are all set for another BlackHat USA slot.
        Now instead of everybody simply switching to iPhone - can we get more researchers into checking how badly Apple patches vulns?
        In particular nobody cares these days until Google project X repeats the claims other researchers did for years (like insecurity of AV,...)

        Obama on crypto @ SXSW speech: technologists should invent a good compromise that solves policy problems. Science harder, everyone.
        Obama also says we're "fetishizing our phones." Maybe I've led a sheltered life, but I never heard of that particular kink.
        Figuring out how to build the reliable, secure systems required to "compromise" on crypto has long been a central problem in CS.
        It's not like no one has thought about this problem before. It's a fundamentally difficult problem, and it won't be solved anytime soon.
        Slightly ironically, the USSS is so far getting an A for correct crypto use at SXSW. They must be fetishizing their encrypted radios now.
        It's not just that we don't know how to do crypto backdoors perfectly, it's that we don't even know how to do them non-disasterously.
        We can't discuss how to make our systems secure with backdoors until we can figure out how to do it WITHOUT backdoors.
        If pressed, FBI seems to acknowledge that backdoors will reduce security at least a little. Do they think it's good enough now?
        OK, yes, I've got an encrypted phone, but it's, um, strictly for work reasons.
        That said, "you nerds should invent secure back doors!" is a much less harmful policy than "backdoors are easy!"
        Hmmm, make that a C.
        Also there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WEIRD about my having three phones.
        And I subscribed to the Bell System Tech Journal only for the articles.

        Trump on evicting protesters: "Part of the problem... part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore."
        More Trump: says police "are being politically correct the way they take [protesters] out. So it takes a little bit longer."
        These Trump quotes are pretty unequivocal. He's definitely egging people on to violence.
        That's not even dog whistling, that's just openly saying it. https://twitter.com/aseaborne/status/708484831319953408 ...
