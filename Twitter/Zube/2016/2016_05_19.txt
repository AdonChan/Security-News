        We imbue computers with such intelligence, treating their ascension like destiny, that seeing the truth of their operation is still a shock.
        The moments of revelation we are told to have with computers, the demonstrations of isolated expertise we're to marvel, remain novelties.

        Delusional self-confidence sounds like the best thing ever right now.
        Note: The update roll-up KB3125574 includes previously limited-release fixes, so you should investigate deploying it universally via WSUS.
        Win7 has two update branches: GDR and LDR. A lot of business-specific fixes never make it to public distribution. This will give you them.
        It doesn't seem that any of the press have picked up on the significance of this update changing the file servicing channels to LDR.
        Specifically, it has incredible numbers of fixes for domain authentication and file sharing (SMB1, SMB2). This is good stuff you should test

        I am in such a good mood today
        . @jalogisch if we had a jailbreak in our app (which we could) it would be an actual legit reason to kill the app
        Luckily recon lightning talks don't require me to drink a double shot for every 5 minutes i talk 
        Btw people arguing about what sense our tool makes should instead argue about how much sense minecraft makes
        The butthurt jealousy of some people when it comes to our app because they have the fantasy that we actually made big money out of this.
        Trolls who call our tool a scam because someone can evade it also call the whole AV/next gen AV industry a scam.
        If Facebook app had a hidden process list detection feature, would it get pulled by Apple?
        All those people crying wolf about our app being bypassed:fact is until today no ios malware with this capability has been found in the wild
        Fact is the app was also an attempt to catch some of the actual deployed iOS malware in the wild (that so far has always been shitty)
        Our app would also detect if your spouse jailbroke your phone to spy on you, because there is no ready made tool to evade our detection, YET
        Now with cryptolockers showing there is big money in ransomware and now knowing how little it takes to be iOS top 1 app I guess ...
        ... we will soon see an iOS picture editor or something similar in the top 10 that turns out to take all your photos hostage after a while.
        The investment a crime syndicate has to make to put their malicious app into the top 10 of the AppStore is far less than what people think.

        Lol apple pulling the App made it actually it into the print version of a german newspaper.
        Considering that csops() is used for security enforcement we users should be concerned that Apple says its output might be misleading/wrong
        Not everyday you see a live sample of a Copy-Cat application on the @AppStore. can you spot the fake...  (cc @i0n1c )pic.twitter.com/7v4E4D8Q05
        Apple throws out our app from AppStore but permits a fraud app with the same name, our logo and a link to our sitehttps://itunes.apple.com/de/app/system-and-security-info/id1113283958?l=en&mt=8 ... 
        So that fake app claims to be us (c) sektioneins. Who do i contact at Apple to get the revenue for that app?pic.twitter.com/NoTBjduCLV
        In a way i am happy cause all this publicly shows that the AppStore review is just security theater and will not stop scammers or bad code
        Hey @AppStore @tim_cook you let imposters sell software in your store claiming to be us. Do we get the money?https://appsto.re/de/211wcb.i 
        @mcr42 @i0n1c @AppStore no, they left (TM) in so it will be dropped fromURL to produce a perfect phishing URL:pic.twitter.com/HrZdG0din8
        The fraud app already goes up into the top 40 in germany and top 3 in its category in germany.
        Reporters: Apple let a fraud App into the AppStore that impersonates us and is already climbing into the AppStore top lists again
        But it also shows how great the demand for our software is. 
        The fraudster app is now top 2 in its category in germany and top 28 overall in germany.

        The fake/imposter/fraud app just made top #1 in category productivity in the german store. People must buy the fraud in masses.
        Looks like imposter app is about to die from the store
        . @bumrufus yeah lets wait until tomorrow when the next fake is in the store again
        Its amazing how many companies are getting rich w/ govt funding for car hacking.  Amount @nudehaberdasher and I received in last 2 yrs: $0.
        So the fraud app managed to become #1 paid productivity app in germany and then was killed from the store.

        Setting up a public preprint service (a la SSRN) isn't 100% free, but it's not expensive, either. Time for the community to just fix this.
        When Elsevier bought SSRN, the valuable assets weren't the servers and disks, they were the papers we uploaded.
        (Speaking here as someone who publishes both in social and anti-social sciences (like engineering).
        If you don't think Elsevier regards things like SSRN as the problem, rather than the solution, I have a large collection of bridges on sale.
        Hugely common misconception: that scientific/academic subscription fees support the research they publish. Nope.
        Research is supported by gov't, foundations, industry. Not publishers. Neither me nor my school gets any of the $ you pay to read my papers.
        "But what about the peer-reviewers, don't they get paid by publishers", you ask?
        .@tomasekeli The publishers.
        Anyway, I've posted this before, but for my thoughts on this, see http://www.crypto.com/blog/copywrongs/ ... 
        Bottom line: if you "pirate" my papers, it's definitely not my pockets you're taking money out of.
        (Note that we're talking here about research papers, not textbooks or magazine articles, where traditional publishing economics apply.)
        To be clear, the problem isn't that authors aren't paid by publishers. The problem is that the publishing model is obsolete & rent-seeking.
        And now several people have helpfully pointed out that I am "obviously" wrong about how this works. And am a communist.
        Next: surge pricing for academic articles.https://twitter.com/orinkerr/status/732701643989495808 ... 
        I must say, @sarahjeong and @xor's live tweeting of Oracle v. Google is totally worth my Twitter subscription fees this month.

        Boris sinks to his knees. "Now Europe is Hitler and bananas are us and we must oscillate the ionosphere and flee the oncoming courgettes!"
        Imagine being fucked by Michael Gove, though. It must be like The Evil Dead set in a bouncy castle.pic.twitter.com/uuEyAOgZhI
        "Darling," I imagine Gove squawks at the crucial moment, "One is on the verge of evacuating one's loins."
        A bloated corpse falls clumsily on a pair of dusty Victorian bellows. They emit a brief spurt of dust. You are having sex with Michael Gove.
        "Oh Michael Gove! Screw me like you screwed education and justice! Demoralise me! Get me ready for privatisation!" Sarah Vine cries lustily.

        BRITAIN.pic.twitter.com/pMn3TgNdYw
        To counter Boris's bullshit, a parliamentary paper from 2010 estimates that at most, 21% -- not 60% - of legislation is influenced by the EU.
        If you exclude secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments), the figure for just primary legislation (Statutes) drops to 6.8%.
        And it costs Britain ยฃ280m per week to be part of the EU, not ยฃ300m, according to this:https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/04/much-britain-pay-eu/ ... 
        The ยฃ20,000,000 per week difference might not be a lot to Boris, but over a year it means he's out by ยฃ1,040,000,000.
        The parliamentary research paper I referred to is here: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP10-62/RP10-62.pdf ... 
        So the upshot is that either Boris is incompetent, or a lying turd. It's not for me to say which (he's a lying turd).
        Of course, Iain Duncan Smith spells it 'Britiain'.

        An investor who tells you it's normal for founders to give up board control is either lying or mistaken.
        There may be advantages to a more independent board. But investors can no longer claim you should do it because it's the norm.
        Now an investor who wants you to give up board control is asking for something unusual, and you should ask why.

        They're bringing it right back. It's down for revision. Why they do this in secret, I have absolutely no idea.https://twitter.com/k4dl/status/732969882434834432 ...

        It's not like external experts in secure messaging are hard to find. But I talk to those people, and YOU HAVEN'T. WHY?
        I heard about the new version of the scorecard months ago. Reaction from crypto experts I talked to about it: "ugh, really?".
        Reaction I received from no crypto expert about the new EFF scorecard: "oh, I'm involved in that project."
        @tqbf EFF is incentivized to make an easy to measure set of policy goals, then publicly claim they "won" them for users to drive donations
        Statistical phrase of the day: "robust sandwich estimator"
        @tqbf IMHO their incentives don't  lend themselves well to a publication like the "SMS." If anything, they should endorse another's list.
