        OS X 10.11.4 made my macbook about 4 times slower than before. Anyone know if there's a fix? Guess I need to reinstall... #goodjobapple
        If you have SUIDGuard trouble I suggest following @dguido's solution https://github.com/sektioneins/SUIDGuard/issues/12 ... 
        Btw I suspected SUIDGuard crashes because I hardcoded two offsets because Apple provides no API to access these values. But THOSE still same
        Furthermore loading SUIDGuard on a already booted 10.11.4 seems to not crash, but when you reboot ...
        My second guess is that the race condition in exec security fix is what broke SUIDGuard.
        Meaning due to the race condition fix the hook i am using might be now to early for task map min_offset validation. But no kdk,src=harddebug
        Does anyone know if SUIGuard also crashes the betas of 10.11.4 or only the final ?

        OS X 10.11.4 made my macbook about 4 times slower than before. Anyone know if there's a fix? Guess I need to reinstall... #goodjobapple
        Ok, the problem appears to have fixed itself. Lasted for about 15 minutes. All good I guess!

        So, did they fix @tayandyou yet?
        Reminds me of what they did to the Morris worm, a bit. https://twitter.com/mimeframe/status/713038325272064000 ... 
        Also reminds me of @SwiftOnSecurity 's notion to install characteristic extensions to make malware not run.
        Oh, I just -love- when someone else shows up on the call all self-righteous-like.
        Let's Encrypt is about to roll out support for Windows XP: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/upcoming-intermediate-changes/13106 ...  Likely some big customers that've been waiting for this.
        On further reading, this is very much like how the Morris worm was neutralized: https://www.lexsi.com/securityhub/abusing-bugs-in-the-locky-ransomware-to-create-a-vaccine/?lang=en ... 
        Oh, joy. the EC-Council malware includes anti-VM countermeasures. And, yes, it's still live. Also, love the phone # pic.twitter.com/MpslocB1pd
        .@kennwhite It's STILL live?! Has nobody at @ECCOUNCIL been paying the slightest bit of attention?!
        Apparently not. Fox-IT and others (me included) have contacted them, including their legal team. It's still up.
        Also, add them to all your blacklists, because this has ceased to even be funny at this point. https://twitter.com/munin/status/713054019103502336 ... 
        And while you're at it - don't hire anyone with a CEH, because obviously this level of idiocy is endemic to that org.
        .@Viss @munin  system fingerprinting (Machine GUID, ProductID, Bios date), autorun, egress via ICMP, vm countermeasures. The full deal.
        Also, if you want to anticipate what money area of tech will be next, I will tell you right now = adversarial machine learning
        if AI is to be more than a gimmick it will need to interact with an impure outside world full of people with varying motives.
        AI and IoT = two things people throw money at but are going to provide lifetime job security for cybersecurity people that focus on them
        I am sad to say that @MattDevost's toaster article may have been an understatement.
