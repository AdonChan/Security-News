        So, a lot of these "anti-drone guns" are basically naked antennas that the operator puts up to his eye. 
        Yes, the antennas that they use are highly directional.
        The yagi design does provide significant gain off the front - but there is another lobe that comes off the back.
        The problem with the lobe coming off the back in that instance is that you're now cooking your face.
        See, VHF, UHF, and microwave freqs - the ones we care about here - have a nasty habit of producing heat when they hit your body.
        This isn't -normally- a problem for most parts of your body; there's very good heat management with all that liquid you're filled with.
        Unfortunately, your cornea doesn't have a whole lot of blood vessels carrying heat away when there's localized heat issues there.
        So when your corneas get heated up, it's hard to get the heat -off- of them; this leads to low-level damage of the corneal structure.
        And when you get damaged corneas, it shows up as cataracts.
        VHF and higher freq induced cataracts are a -very- well known issue with people who work with radio.

        I just watched underworld blood wars. In other words I just lost two hours of my life.
        So apparently @fouseyTUBE 's Twitter account has been hacked (unless this is a stunt) so much for 2FA.
        So @fouseyTUBE is @verified, has a million followers and @twitter doesn't realize the account is hacked and deletes all his tweets for > 1h
        Annahme der 10 iPods von @cyberport_de verweigert. Dank Packungsmaterialverschwendung hÃ¤tten auch 50 iPods in die Verpackung gepasst.
        So apparently @Twitter reconstructed the tweets of @fouseyTUBE including all those done by the hacker (asking for nudes, hate against jews)
        I finally have a few pink iPods to teach jailbreaking on.
        So according to https://youtu.be/ljlEQXytcEM  the @fouseyTUBE hack was again mobile phone/SMS auth being defeated by non nation state actors
        I guess one can say if you are a t-mobile usa customer and might piss off people on the internet better don't use mobile phone auth anywhere
        Ohh look @qwertyoruiopz is attacking me again. Wonder if he does that because of his israelian employers...

        23. The Algorithm is scalable, automated, and seems totally value-neutral. Right? It delivers everything everyone wants.
        24. Facebook and Google slowly become the editor for the planet through The Algorithm. New media outlets live and die by The Algorithm.
        25. But odd problems start cropping up. Facebook's The Algorithm censors Pulitzer Prize winning Vietnam era photo from Norwegian news.
        26. Turns out Facebook is misleading on traffic numbers for major news sites.http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-discloses-another-metrics-mishap-affecting-publishers-1481896803 ... 
        27. Optimization, aka gaming The Algorithm, becomes an industry. This opens the way for modern fake news.
        28. Completely made up, riding on The Algorithm, perhaps foreign propaganda, crops up like barnacles on the bottom of a boat.
        29. This is a function of the centralization of power in the hands of The Algorithm, aka Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page.
        30. No matter how competent, no one person can be the editor for all of humanity. The Algorithm is the mother of all absentee ownership.
        31. The response to the 'fake news' panic has been authoritarian. It has been 'why won't Facebook censor things I don't like!?!'
        32. So Facebook announces it will censor. And it may engage in "policy enforcement actions" to cut off $$$ to media. http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/news-feed-fyi-addressing-hoaxes-and-fake-news/ ... 
        33. FB acts as a sovereign power unto itself. It outsources censorship to sites like Politifact, a site with clear policy biases.
        34. Hoping that if it does this outsourcing, people won't notice FB's total control over our free speech commons via The Algorithm.
        35. But fundamentally, such control is not consistent with a democracy, with a free press, or with freedom of association.
        36. There are many policy approaches to this problem. But it is not a problem of 'fake news', it is a problem of concentrated monopoly power
        37. Fake news is simply the barnacles that aren't being cleaned out of the system b/c Mark Zuckerberg can't get to them all.
        38. It's worse today, but this is a longstanding issue. Fourteen years ago, it was fake news around the war in Iraq.
        39. What we need to restore democracy is a wholesale anti-monopoly approach to our media ecosystem, starting but not ending w/ the platforms
        40. Communities must have the ability to organize their own public commons for debate and speech, unmediated by private monopolies.
        41. Otherwise, we will not be dealing just with Fake News, but with a Fake Democracy as well. There, that's my tweet storm.
