        Bill from #Apple keeps lying to us. He now says there might be some apps with jailbreak detection cause they were released before the rule.
        BTW at the moment our iOS app is rejected due to 1.1.6 - offensive false information, trick joke functionality #Bill is such a joker
        . @iMokhles Apple are just liars: they knowingly allow big companies, banks and payment apps to have jailbreak detection.
        See it is okay when #paypal has jailbreak detection, because they have lawyers. Or #pokemongo because they bring tons of in app sales.
        . @midkin0 apple disallowed us even to publish a version of the app that had BOTH removed
        BTW:Apple rejecting our App based on 1.1.6 means they think:content is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intending to disgust or poor taste
