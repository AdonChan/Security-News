        The SEC official who blocked going after higher-ups at Goldman described potential targets as "good people who had done one bad thing,'"
        "Securities and Exchange Commission considered & rejected a much broader case against Goldman and John Paulson & Co"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/723184449546948608 ... 
        The SEC had the goods on Goldman Sachs execs & chose not to act. @eisingerj has he goods on the SEC and filed thishttp://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-the-s-e-c-didnt-hit-goldman-sachs-harder?intcid=mod-latest ... 
        Wow. This by @eisingerjhttp://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-the-s-e-c-didnt-hit-goldman-sachs-harder?intcid=mod-latest ... 
        I have been skeptical that Goldman did anything wrong (bespoke shorts are a normal thing). But this..
        Here is the source for my SEC story today, Jim Kidney, on why he came forward about the lax Goldman investigation:http://www.watchthecircus.com/financial/why-i-belatedly-blew-the-whistle-on-the-secs-failure-to-properly-investigate-goldman-sachs/ ...

        Well done The Queen for being 90. All that travel between palaces can be hard on a privileged multi-millionaire, but you wear it with grace.
        The Queen will be visiting a bus stop later to say "I'm 90, you know" to a complete stranger.
        Queen announces new six second death metal national anthem: "It's the Queen, It's the Queen / Bow down peasants or she'll eat your spleen."
        I think it's a bit much that David Cameron will be tributing the Queen in the House of Commons later.
        Cameron tributes the Queen: "What a Queen. Winston Churchill once witnessed her pull a man's head clean off. Remarkable. I call her mummy."
        I preferred the Queen when she was just a humble underground bare knuckle prize fighter in Saigon in the late fifties.
        I preferred the Queen when she drove the 1983 Paris-Dakar Rally in a Mercedes 1936 AK and was photographed having a shit in the desert.
        Words from Dame Carol Ann Duffy on Her Majesty's birthday:
        Sky News is already padding and waffling about Prince and it's not even confirmed he's dead yet.
        AP has it. Prince is dead.
