        I've become convinced that only employee pressure can make Facebook honest about data collection/retention. Let's unionize Facebook in 2017
        Plenty of ethical, honest people work at Facebook. But they're absent from the top levels of management, and Zuckerberg has no moral compass
        Facebook has monopoly power and is structured so shareholders can't revolt. But there's one neat trick to make management listen to workers
        Only demands I have of Facebook are: 
        Probably throw in 4) "No more open plan offices" in order to make collective action sit better with the National Labor Relations Board
        It's ridiculous that the only way to know something is deleted on Facebook is to nuke your account and wait 2 months. We have the technology
        @Pinboard Just before I die laughing, can I point you to Alliance@IBM for a brief history lesson on how that kind of thing goes? KThxBye.

        Which "NY Russian facility" is being shut down? Glen Cove or Riverdale?
        I believe the Riverdale compound is the main residence for the Russian mission to the UN, so I'm guessing Glen Cove.
        Fun fact: The Riverdale Russian compound sits in the path of the (now defunct) AT&T Long Lines microwave circuit from White Plains to NYC.
        White Plains was a MAJOR toll office serving NYC, so a LOT of interesting traffic presumably traversed that circuit...
        Hmm, according to this it's ANOTHER compound on LI that's being closed, in Oyster Bay. I'd never heard of this one.https://www.buzzfeed.com/otilliasteadman/this-is-what-it-was-like-at-the-russian-intelligence-sites-t ...

        If the press in 2002 had been like there's no evidence Iraq has wmd's we wouldn't have a fake news problem. Getting big stuff wrong matters.
        This is also incidentally why saying 'there's not enough evidence to support this claim by people with power' shouldn't be dismissed.

        Converted a heavy cronjob to a system with queues and multiple workers for processing. Took less than 1h.
        Scheduled a few more beta invites for @dnsspy for tomorrow, the rest is queued for 2017.
        Sounds like a long time still, but that's only 3 more days 
        Lots of improvements in the latest release of @dnsspy too, speed increases of up to 10x, zone-transfer monitoring, stability++
        Really liking the point where it's at now. If the next round(s) of feedback are OK(ish), I'll hit the big red launch button.

        I admit the gentle animal was slandered a bit, but a vampire squid isn't exactly toothless. It has a beak, in any case.https://twitter.com/grizzly_stats/status/814716097844957184 ... 
        I saw that, along with the pseudo-retraction by the Guardian. Part of a pattern I'm writing about today actually. @ggreenwaldhttps://twitter.com/dem_a_dog/status/814868177268199424 ... 
        It is apparently true that the Vampire Squid is among the most passive of all squids. It basically waits for for food to come its way.https://twitter.com/agejustnumbers/status/814874764414242816 ... 
        Numerous zoologist/oceanographer types contacted me to complain on the squid's behalf after the original Goldman story.https://twitter.com/agejustnumbers/status/814874764414242816 ... 
        I once had a giant plush squid sent to my home as a gift. One of my relatives has also promised to bury me with a squid.https://twitter.com/dadsyellinagain/status/814875844996759552 ... 
        The Guardian just had to amend their story based on his reporting, so @ggreenwald isn't the one with the fact problem here.https://twitter.com/im2b/status/814875979109769216 ...

        I REALLY want to know what AV vendors failed to identify the malware used by APT28 and APT29.
        I worked for the government from 2004-2012; patriotism only goes so far when the brightest leave for  and you have 'lifers' warming chairs.

        So my insta-take is this is a good raft of measures, and bulk of the response is an overt (and non-cyber) response. \o/
        Key things to watch for: 
        Hey, everyone : @arstechnica 's DeathWatch 2017 hits the web tomorrow. Who made the cut? Hint: '17 not good year for companies w/ "Y" names.
        We've added a new special recognition category for DeathWatch 2017: what once was dead will never die.

        @joshtpm @RusEmbUSA sanctions are only allowing Coreldraw CDs from 1992 into Russia.
        I've got a better idea than sanctions: CIA should endorse GRU and FSB officers on LinkedIn as "assets"...  the system will work itself out.
