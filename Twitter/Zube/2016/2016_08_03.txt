        FCA's response to our work is a crack up as usual.  See http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/this-time-miller-and-valasek-hack-the-jeep-at-speed/d/d-id/1326468 ...  for the response.
        Basically they said car hacking is hard and also requires you to have a car.  I know I feel better now.

        I think the reason why so many Repubs reject Trump is that they prefer their fascism more folksy.
        At this rate, once Hillary accuses Trump of spitting on soldiers in airports, she officially becomes Nixon.

        PSA: FlockFlock will run on El Capitan, but not on Sierra without disabling SIP, as I am waiting for a kext signing cert from Apple. Soon.
        So macOS Sierra seems to report the wrong vnode often in hooking mpo_vnode_check_exec; any other good way to get path to pid from KPI?
        Something seems quite broken in Sierra beta that's preventing FlockFlock from returning the correct process path.pic.twitter.com/1sFoiSwXyx
        Looks like you don't have to disable SIP to use FlockFlock, you can do a "csrutil enable --without-kext" until I get a kext cert. Cool.

        Trump no longer able to use the slogan "He'll make the elevators run on time"http://www.krdo.com/news/new-details-emerge-in-trump-elevator-rescue/40966226 ... 
        I have policy differences with Clinton on some issues that are important to me. But Trump is an existential threat to things I hold dear.
        Do I like compromising? Of course not. But that's the price of admission to society.
        Before you get on the plane, be sure to check Twitter to see if this year's Defcon has been canceled. #BadDefconAdvice

        Several prominent cases involving passing info to China have fallen apart recently, e.g.,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/us/politics/us-drops-charges-that-professor-shared-technology-with-china.html?_r=0 ...

        During Defcon, most of the slot machines at the conference hotel have been hacked to give high payouts. It's a sure thing! #BadDefconAdvice
        The #BadDefconAdvice hashtag is ironic. It's actually all good advice. #ExtremelyBadDefconAdvice
        1/ The story comes from the criminal complaint, available here, if you want to follow along: https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/881161/download ... 
        The people making you feel intimidated and excluded at Defcon are the ones who don't belong there. #ActualDefconAdvice.
        Inspired by this to state explicitly: I'll be at Defcon. If you're having a bad time please reach out and say hey.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/760271834281541633 ... 
        I'll vote for whichever candidate credibly promises to deliver a Twitter edit button.
        Defcon is the week when Las Vegas replaces many of it's drunk people who don't understand math with drunk people who do understand math.

        Just kidding. As the title of a Lewis Sinclair book I never read once said, it can't happen here
        I like the name @chrislhayes gives this new right-wing social movement: The 'American National Front'
        Paul Nehlen, Paul Ryan's primary challenger, proudly talks of himself as a private equity and big biz guy.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4vq7q4/wisconsin_for_the_love_of_america_please_watch/ ... 
        National Front in France is dominated by financiers. Probably similar across the world.
        American Front GOP candidate Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) has an economic strategy: the scaled tariff. http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/01/a_scaled_tariff_would_help_bal.html ... 
        This American National Front movement is self-consciously international. Paul Nehlen dislikes the EU as much as he does the TPP.
        The way that tariff policy is just considered rude to even analyze is odd. It's a very traditional policy tool.
        Today experts are saying there's no broad problem with student debt and homeownership is bad. No idea why people distrust experts.
        This economist misses the point. Homeownership gives people a stake in their society. Get rid of that stake and... http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/08/02/homeownership-at-50-year-low-so-what/theres-little-public-benefit-in-homeownership?smid=tw-share ... 
        "Homeowners are better citizens, but we shouldn't screw up the $28 trillion housing market to mildly increase engagement in local politics."
        "When homeowners get involved in politics, they often try to stop new development which makes housing less affordable for everyone else."
        This isn't expertise, this is an ideologue who has a certain vision of society pushing it with his fancy Harvard professor title.
        And then there's this fool, who says that student debt isn't a problem except for people who can't pay it back.http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487032643/is-the-student-loan-crisis-fact-or-fiction ... 
        Having enormous student debt, even if you can pay it back, sucks. And it sucks for years. It's a huge problem.
        No, the student debt crisis is not 'manufactured by the media'. No one's having fun w/debt until told otherwise.http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487032643/is-the-student-loan-crisis-fact-or-fiction ... 
        Amazingly, people don't feel loyalty to maintaining status quo in society where they are in debt for life.

        Victims of harassment need to be able to talk to people. Not letting them do that hurts their health and drives them out of the industry.
        (not aimed at any individual company, this shit is rampant in the industry)
        It's not like people who talk about harassment are aiding their employment prospects anyway. Don't make it even worse than it already is.
