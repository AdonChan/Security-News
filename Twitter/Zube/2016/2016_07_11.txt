        Re: OurMine allegations about Vine passwords: the admin site is restricted to Twitter IPs, is https, and never shows passwords in any form.
        We securely store our passwords per industry best practice (bcrypt).
        Okay, so I'm into passwords and all things infosec, but my feed is full of Pokemo Go. Even worse than 22 guys chasing a ball for 90mins!

        It is possible to mostly disarm the police. Even pragmatic! Stop hiring assault officers, hire unarmed compliance/monitoring officers.
        Disarm police forces through attrition. Saves money, addresses pension problems, reduces load on police assault forces.
