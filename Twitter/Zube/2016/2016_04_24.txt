        What if "someone gave us the passcode" is the new "we used IP BOX to brute force it and the guy who ran it told us what the pin was"?
        FBI is determined to use command-z in every AWA case until it gets one right.
        FBI refusing to say who gave them the pin in NY; admitting they used a tool/service again will ruin all chances of winning future AWA cases.
        Impressive how the All Writs Act always results in the FBI doing their jobs. We should use it more often.

        If you discuss the contents of employee exit interviews publicly, your employees will not be honest with you in exit interviews.
        (There's no incentive for them to be honest in the first place, but if you want to guarantee it I can't think of any better way)
        Disclosing the contents of exit interviews in an industry that commonly forces people to sign NDAs on the way out is, uh, a problem.
