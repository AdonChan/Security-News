        Multiple helpdesk tickets have been closed with Apple iCloud removal as the fix. I just go straight to the registry to nuke it domain-wide.

        Don't use crypto (which we have tech for). Instead, focus on securing whole systems (which we don't know how to do).
        This article is so technically misinformed, I don't know where to start. For example, it seems to think public key crypto isn't end-to-end.
        It also weirdly suggests that every bit you encrypt takes away from security of other parts of a system, rather than strengthening them.
        It's true that end-to-end crypto doesn't solve all security problems. But it's a critically important tool in a very small arsenal.
        These policy pieces must be written in a world where security is SO GOOD that we can afford to throw out working tools. Good luck with that.

        Two random things I noticed from the Podesta emails. One, Clinton herself ordered opposition to TPP based on ISDS.  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4920 ... 
        Two, Clinton advisor Mandy Grunwald said "Why does nobody ever go to jail?" after banks were busted rigging forex.
        This is horrible disinformation TPP opponent Putin is spewing.

        One striking thing about reading the Podesta emails is how HRC advisors is how they seem steeped in academic norms.
        Sperling for instance wants to tout ideas that he or his campaign came up with. But why?
        Why does it matter? HRC could say "I agree with so-and-so on X, and I'm going to use idea X." That demonstrates strength.
        The only place it doesn't is... in academia, where that's seen as cheating.

        No. This is absolutely categorically wrong.
        Exerting monopolist influence over citizen access to government is, on all levels, not only unethical but antithetical to democratic gov't.
        This attitude is nothing short of an attempt to control gov't access by corporate interests, and needs to be quashed immediately.

        Prediction: 1) this becomes the most misunderstood & misused feature, 2) Signal "fixes" it by implementing full DRM, killing any openness.https://twitter.com/whispersystems/status/785929104189120512 ... 
        Photograph of a screen hardly provides any evidence, because easily falsified. So, not so valuable as means to bypass a messaging app DRM.https://twitter.com/okayultra/status/786132002445504512 ... 
        I'm not saying that full Remote Attestation-enforced DRM has no good applications. All I'm saying: either openness XOR DRM-based features.
