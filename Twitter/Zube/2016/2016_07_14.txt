        $1500 for a car bug that can literally murder people, $1m if you can pop an iphone. Bugbounty economy is ... not fully worked out yet.
        Congrats to Fiat-Chrylser which launched their bug bounty program:http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2016/07/13/fca-invites-white-hat-hackers-attack-its-software/86962334/ ... 
        $1500 seems cheap to me, but at least its paid (looking at you GM).  I think its the first company besides Tesla to do that.
        ...and no they didn't retroactively pay us for last year :)
        Seems a little strange, considering we were on the phone with them last week, that I had to hear about it from @rantyben #communitybuilding
        I would, personally, pay $1500 to brick every Chrysler in the US, just because it's fucking hilarious
        I could have made a few dollars if you look at FCA stock after wired report went live.https://twitter.com/rantyben/status/753238831042695172 ...

        Some portions of XPrivacy might actually work, but a large portion appears to simply inject client-side checks that are trivially bypassed.
        It doesn't even require any intention to actually bypass it but rather simply using native code or a different Java API that's not replaced.
