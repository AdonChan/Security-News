        [SuggestedReading] Attack of the Week: Apple iMessage http://ift.tt/1o2IcUB 
        Let's be clear: the government hasn't dropped its case against Apple. A hearing was canceled, that's all.
        Just hearing about the Brussels terror attacks. Hoping that friends are OK...  thoughts go out to those lost in another senseless attack!
        Oracle removed their claim that double encryption is illegal from their SSL docs (cc @tqbf, @matthew_d_green, @svbl) https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/asossl.htm#DBSEG9680 ... 
        The countdown to "It was all crypto's fault!" arguments begins again...  :(

        If Apple has privacy czars, why are OS X and iOS still a trove of forensic artifacts? Apple needs to start thinking about this in design.
        Today, if I delete an iMessage, it stays on a free list in SQLite, and is sent to two more computers after the fact. This isn't good design.
        The best way Apple can prevent the iPhone from being such a forensics target is to keep it from storing so much forensic trace. @tim_cook
        Criticizing Apple's forensic design as I sit here reading thousands of months' old deleted iMessages, geotags etc on my daughter's iPhone.
        Not only are iMessages not purged, iOS actually drops a special record that tells forensics experts when a conversation is deleted.
        Apple's doing a remarkable job with security; it's time to start redesigning apps to be proactive in limiting forensic exposure.
        Recommended SQLite design: Shadow file system encryption; use aes-wrap for each record, class keys in keybag. Overwrite wrap on rec delete.
        Please don't take this as me criticizing Apple's engineers. They've done some really great stuff; it's crucial this gets addressed though.

        Whatever the outcome here, someone will eventually make a handset that neither vendor nor FBI can crack. FBI then asks congress for a law.

        "We'd better hold a COBRA meeting," David Cameron says in his most grown-up voice, his chubby pig-loving penis achieving instant tumescence.
        BBC: "Tell me where you were and what you saw. Did you see the bombers literally fly apart? Where you hit by any of their limbs? TELL ME."
        BBC: "Describe the scene for us. Include as much gory detail as you can. Did you see any dead people? I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING."
        Nice to see BBC News using the Ken Burns effect on the photographs of the dead and injured in Brussels. Makes it all seem more tasteful.
        BBC: "How far away were you from the explosion? Were you blown off your feet like you see in the films? Did you shout 'NOOOOOOOOOOO'?"
        BBC: "What did you see? What did you smell? Did you taste the bomb? Did your spidey sense tingle? Did you hear innocence weep? ANSWER NOW."
        "I think we can see pictures of people injured in the incident" says BBC News presenter with barely disguised excitement.
        BBC: "Oh thank God we've got some dramatic new footage. Some people running away there. Idiots. The bomb's already gone off."
        Cameron: "I am shocked by the events in Brussels. We will do everything we can to exploit this situation for our own political ends."
        Everyone's so down on terrorists. If just once a politician said "they *might* succeed" maybe terrorists would feel better about themselves.
        "Suicide bombers" is too glamorous a term. I vote from now on they be referred to as "self-rupturing ballbags".
