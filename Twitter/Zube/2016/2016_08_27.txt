        Hillary says the GOP has been captured by a "radical fringe." Given the mainstream reactionaries flocking to her, what else do Repubs have?

        Heard from an employee of a Fortune 100 company, IT is cutting off any iPhone without the latest patch trying to connect.
        Little Flocker 0.0.70 is now available, and sports Sparkle integration, so you won't have to manually upgrade anymore.
        If all goes according to plan, Little Flocker users should receive their first Sparkle update to 0.0.71 on next reboot, or within 24 hours.

        You are not allowed to feign surprise, after EQG dump, that NSA is stockpiling vulnerabilities. That is fake and I see you.
        To say you're surprised, you must ALSO assert either:
        1. You have paid no attention to computer security over the last 20 years and thus didn't know other entities stockpile vulnerabilities.
        2. You honestly believed that NSA was unique among all SIGINT agencies in NOT deploying undisclosed vulnerabilities.
        Essentially, arguing: "well sure yeah I knew UAE could buy iOS jailbreak drive-by from Israel, but NSA DOING THAT TO CHINA? NFW."
        Doesn't make NSA SIGINT good! In particular: NSA has no business whatsoever owning IAD anymore.

        If I understand things correctly, a non-public security flaw that would impact the stock price is clearly "material non-public info"?
        Wow Kudos to @justinembone ! The best metric of valuing risk in your business !https://twitter.com/nselby/status/768884352134615040 ... 
        To be fair, Muddy Waters has a lot of experience with this stuff.
        Kudos to @justinembone for causing the most interesting legal considerations around EULAs, stocks, and holding companies accountable. :-)
        So the legal argument would be: Analyzing the publicly pacemakers for security flaws is deriving information from existing public info, ...
        ... hence the derived security flaws are OK under "mosaic theory". Now the big question is: If a EULA violation can be proven, does this ...
        ... impact the legality in any way? Or does it just open your flank to a lawsuit for damages? Also: This development may actually be ...
        ... the most direct "holding accountable" for security issues that I have seen. Kudos for courage / boldness, @justinembone !

        Imagine this guy had @i0n1c's app installed which would show him he's been remotely jailbroken ;)https://twitter.com/EvilPenguin_/status/768861245327880192 ... 
        Had #SysSecInfo of #SektionEins the #Pegasus Trident recognized? Based on the info from #Lookout [PDF] https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-technical-analysis.pdf ...  @i0n1c
        Afaik it is not mentioned in the report by lookout security (for obvious reasons)https://twitter.com/defensivedepth/status/768867974321057792 ... 
        So can anyone infected with #pegasus trident verify if #SysSecInfo would have detected it?
        Big question: did Nobody try to use #SysSecInfo on that dissidents phone or was that info redacted due to Lookout/Apple request?
        That technical report by Lookout seems to have zero info on the kernel components used. Anyone who has a sample for me?
        Seriously, what harm to Apple could there be from me being able to pull up a screen like this? @i0n1cpic.twitter.com/S5OXNsOEvB
        Speaking of iOS. Later today (3pm singapore time) will be my talk about the iOS 10 Kernel Heap at @HITBGSEC
        News of the NSO remote jailbreak exploit for iOS  makes it hard to understand why Apple banned  info security app 
        Why should Apple pay a bug bounty to @citizenlab at all? They neither discovered vulns nor wrote the exploits...https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/768959017213431808 ... 
        Hmm. Maybe i should stop ignoring all those spearfishing emails and investigate ?!???
        Teaser for my @HITBGSEC iOS 10 Kernel Heap Talk... Don't worry that is one of very few slides with code.pic.twitter.com/J1a52p3bxu
        .@citizenlab favors @Lookout which sells subscriptions to a snake-oil security app while Apple bans the app that actually works #SysSecInfo
        .@citizenlab why does the NGO sample only goes to Lookout? Is there a financial incentive? Where is you full donor list? Do we pay to play?
        Slides from my @HITBGSEC talk are online: "iOS 10 Kernel Heap Revisted" http://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2016/D2%20-%20Stefan%20Esser%20-%20iOS%2010%20Kernel%20Heap%20Revisited.pdf ... 
        You know the irony is Apple removing jsc binary from device in iOS 6 and bringing it back in iOS 7(?). Something i mentioned during training
        Not mentioned on slides: iOS 10 will fix the possible integer overflow in kern_os_malloc() that i mentioned 5 years ago at #cansecwest
        People who use kernel exploits that require sandbox escapes first should grind harder.https://twitter.com/diogomonica/status/769205905007140864 ...

        Oh fuck's sake Linus
        Hundreds of millions of devices that run free software purely because of lawsuits. An entire developer culture that exists as a result.
        A generation of hackers that discover Linux because they can run Cyanogenmod on their phones because of GPL enforcement
        Gaping security flaws discovered only because vendors released source code under duress. Security features ported to abandoned devices.
        And he has the fucking gall to say that enforcement actions have achieved nothing other than to alienate people?
        Sure, if creating new cottage industries, if enabling innovation in markets he never conceived of, if encouraging new developers is nothing.
        People have devoted their lives to getting source out of vendors. They deserve better than contempt. (Context: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-August/003580.html ... )
        And yes, all of this is possible because of Linus' work. But all of his work is only possible because of the GNU project's work.
        We all build on the shoulders of those who came before us. Let's pay it forwards so others can do the same.

        Probably because they outsourced their email infra to google or summat, like the last guy, and didn't have control to set up a relay.
        Because that's an often underestimated benefit of running your own mail infra - the ability to use proper standards-compliant means of...
        ...interfacing your stuff together, rather than guessing at a vendor's non-standards-compliant behavior.
        Not to mention having enough control over your infra to make these things behave usefully.
        Not to mention having things work reliably rather than deal with Si.Valley's obsession with moving fast and breaking things.
        The 'cloud' ain't going to do a damn bit of good for you if none of your stuff knows how to talk to this year's model.
        It's a lot easier to work -with- someone whose behavior you can help rather'n -against- some provider you can't.

        Kudos to @justinembone for causing the most interesting legal considerations around EULAs, stocks, and holding companies accountable. :-)
        So the legal argument would be: Analyzing the publicly pacemakers for security flaws is deriving information from existing public info, ...
        ... hence the derived security flaws are OK under "mosaic theory". Now the big question is: If a EULA violation can be proven, does this ...
        ... impact the legality in any way? Or does it just open your flank to a lawsuit for damages? Also: This development may actually be ...
        ... the most direct "holding accountable" for security issues that I have seen. Kudos for courage / boldness, @justinembone !
        At some point the public will understand its not the researchers who put bugs in products. Congrats, @justinembone!https://twitter.com/nselby/status/768884352134615040 ...

        You are not allowed to feign surprise, after EQG dump, that NSA is stockpiling vulnerabilities. That is fake and I see you.
        To say you're surprised, you must ALSO assert either:
        1. You have paid no attention to computer security over the last 20 years and thus didn't know other entities stockpile vulnerabilities.
        2. You honestly believed that NSA was unique among all SIGINT agencies in NOT deploying undisclosed vulnerabilities.
        Essentially, arguing: "well sure yeah I knew UAE could buy iOS jailbreak drive-by from Israel, but NSA DOING THAT TO CHINA? NFW."
        Doesn't make NSA SIGINT good! In particular: NSA has no business whatsoever owning IAD anymore.
