        This System Management Mode vulnerability is more nice than ThinkPwn: it's much more easy to exploit it from running operating system [2/x]
        I had a quick look over all of the Lenovo SMM drivers -- their code quality is quite poor, I guess there's still a lot of similar vulns [3/x]
        And Lenovo is not even the lamest vendor on the market, it illustrates that modern defensive stuff like Device Guard is practically useless

        From the "not even wrong department", FBI director says voting systems are secure because they're "clunky".http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-voting-system-so-clunky-it-is-insulated-from-hacking-fbi-director-says-1473368396 ... 
        This is explaining a lot about crypto policy.
        He seems to mean "decentralized" is a security plus, which is true, but their (definite) clunkiness is definitely not a security virtue.
        "We will build a key escrow system so clunky, no one will ever be able to hack it."
        For the record, my group of 7 students managed to find exploitable flaws in those systems in just a few weeks. BECAUSE they're clunky.

        When there are two different hearings in congress that you want to watch at the same time. No, I'm not a policy nerd. Not at all.
        Central problem in discussing e-voting security is to avoid being shrill about genuinely catastrophic risks.
        E-voting systems are terrible, we absolutely must improve them. Doesn't mean any particular election was or will be rigged.
        It's especially distressing that election officials feel backed into a corner where they defend insecure technology.

        I saw a 10 minute conversation on national TV before the #Ramsvs49ers game about the national anthem.
        The discussion was on social justice. Colin Kaepernick won't let us hide from our institutions and ourselves. This is very good.
        Protesting players - young black Americans - are using the power they have for social justice. This is leadership and I admire them for it.
        I cannot imagine the sacrifice it takes to get to that level of accomplishment. And to risk it all for justice for others is remarkable.
        Politicians can manipulate, but ultimately politics reflects what the public demands. And the public is demanding a better world.

        I mostly focus on industrial organization questions, so now I'll go back to that.
        don't put your hatred in our hearts. I love this country. don't let the love for a symbol overrule the love for your fellow human.

        Hoocoodanode?* (h/t @DougHenwood) 
        U.S. household incomes in 2015:
        Census data questions. Median household income up 5%, but income of men up by 1.5% and women up 2.7%. How much of this is more ppl working?
        More census data question. People outside metro statistical areas saw their wages drop by 2.0%. Is the non-MSA areas the rural economy?
        The reporting on the census is off. No it's not a 5% raise, that's per household. It's a 1.5% raise for men and 2.7% raise for women.
        Example: "Average Americans Just Got a Huge Income Boost"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/census-bureau-poverty-income_us_57d81e15e4b09d7a687fb02a?section=& ... 
        Don't get me wrong, a 2% raise is good news. But what's happening is mostly just more people per household are working.
        And the 2% fall in income for rural Americans is worth understanding as well.
        @matthewstoller good caveat here - non-MSA excludes rural areas in counties inside MSAs. http://cber.cba.ua.edu/asdc/metro_micro.html ... 
        @matthewstoller essentially yes. And small towns if that excludes "micropolitan areas"

        Why do I block ads?
        Ad networks that distribute -ANYTHING- executable are too dangerous to allow.
        Any site that demands you take off your adblocker before loading content is what we refer to as a wateringhole.
        Those sites are -specifically- targeted in order to harm the visitors who are less likely to have protections in place.
        A site asking you to disable your ad-blocker is exactly like a program asking you to disable your anti-virus.https://twitter.com/munin/status/775762401861828608 ...

        I think headlines about James Woolsey endorsing Trump should include that he believes Grover Norquist is a Muslim Brotherhood secret agent.

        Why is Grover Norquist a Muslim Brotherhood agent, according to Woolsey? Because his wife, Samah, is Palestinian.https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/775722291078443012 ...
