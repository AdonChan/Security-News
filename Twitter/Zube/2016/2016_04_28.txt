        10 U.S.C. Â§2674(c)(3) & 32 C.F.R. Â§234.7(b) make it a federal crime to make an obscene gesture at the Pentagon in order to alarm people.

        1. Most comedians I've known support the Dem Party, especially at election time. Their "edge" softens when voting for a prez.
        2. Tonight, many of them are applauding Hillary, which is no surprise. Celebrity heat melts the coldest of hearts.
        3. Plus, Trump gives them an easy, satirical target. He's a cartoon while Hillary's the Serious Deal.
        4. So that's where we're at. Have I mentioned my love for Laurel and Hardy?

        All you dupes who paid for my Antarctic trip could have funded this box that throws away 2/3 of your coffee instead:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rafino/the-rafino-coffee-grind-refining-system ... 
        Nothing makes coffee taste better than explaining to the beardo next to you how they are drinking liquid garbage due to over-extraction
        Of course all your effort is wasted if you haven't ensured that your water molecules are of uniform size
        Even so-called "distilled" water contains deuterium and measurable quanties of H3O+ and OH- ions, which can profoundly affect flavor
