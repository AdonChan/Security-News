        True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.

        .@michaelhoffman e.g. I put useful things in my dot files then forget to use them, or forget I customized something that's causing trouble.
        Also handy: keep your dot files synchronized across machines and backed up using something like github, Dropbox, etc.

        @a_profligate @0xcharlie @halvarflake @mdowd he has a point but we are from the age of generalists.
        My twitter feed is full of people playing fantasy baseball with imagined skills or non-skills.
        Yes, there are different skillsets for hacking, vuln-dev, implant-dev, etc. etc. - and specialists often outperform generalists.
        Today was day #1 of the 1st CENSUS internal security symposium at Athens; great talks and ideas exchange. Looking forward to day #2 tomorrow
        Also: Success in all of the mentioned fields is usually heavily reliant on resources available (time, money, infra).
        In all fairness, I wouldn't mind having a job for a few years where I got to actually hack w/o fear of legal reprisals. Would learn a lot.
        Warning to my Twitter followers: I am flu-ish and fevering, so probably not making a whole lot of sense today.
        I take the contrary position -- aggressive use of a debugger gives you insight you won't get by mere inspection.https://twitter.com/Code_Analysis/status/745542120379809792 ... 
        The debugger vs print statements debate is bullshit. You need both, in different situations.
        The statements "debuggers do not scale in modern concurrent architectures, hence they are useless" should read "we need better debuggers".
        This is an interesting view from Microsoft but does avoid some of the hard questions/issues:https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2016/06/23/cybersecurity-norms-nation-states-global-ict-industry/#sm.00009t26ob1am3drttart6gqmlb4b ...

        I just realized that this year was the first time i spent a week at @reconmtl without visiting Benelux a single time.Next year without Nyks?
        Nobody seems to question why Apple "intentionally" left 64 bit kernel unencrypted but "intentionally" encrypted 32 bit kernel in iOS beta 1
        "We do not encrypt for performance reasons... That is why we still encrypt on the old slow devices but not on the fast 64 bit devices"
        The more likely reason is that Apple failed to encrypt and now needed an official statement to save face.
        Btw while it is arguable that keeping the kernel encrypted has security impact(after all there is the osx kernel binary),exposing watchtower
        Has negative impact on security.oh yeah and those arguments about apple stopping vulnerability hoarding by decrypting are just nonsense by
        By the usual suspects that always get quoted on ios stories because a hundred years ago they did some ios stuff...
        However leaving the kernel decrypted results in lower income for the parties that sell the 64 bit iOS encryption keys.
        Hilarious that some people believe a decrypted kernelcache somehow reveals all the security vulnerabilities in iOS. Those in the business...
        ...of looking for iOS vulnerabilities always had access to decrypted kernels,by dumping,decrypting or buying keys.
        The only people who had no access to decrypted iOS 64 bit kernels were defenders and bad attackers.
        Trainees who see my IOKit object IDApython script fail with the iOS 10 kernel.This is due to a bug in the idapython ARM64 emulator.Easy fix.
        Waiting for result of #brexit. People saying no to EU and then government ignoring the vote (which they are allowed to do)

        Is there any osx python level debugger for python interpreters embedded in things like IDA?
        For the record: it has been weeks since I reported Carat to Apple for showing and exfiltrating the processlist. Nothing happened...

        Don't normally think of C-SPAN as the world's most aggressive, scrappy news org, but you have to hand it to them today.
        Also, the GOP ordering the official video feed cut obviously backfired. This way looks much more "occupied".
        For the record, I favor strong gun control & I hate terrorists as much as anyone, but secret watch lists are a terrible way to do this.
        A big lesson of last night's (Periscoped) congressional sit-in was how important robust, decentralized Internet platforms are for democracy.
        For me, that demonstration of the power of censorship-resistant media was more profound than the gun issue (which I also care deeply about).
        If a major political party (with a sitting president!) needs the ability to bypass centralized communication networks, so do we all.
        Whether you agreed with them or not is beside the point. You got to see it and decide for yourself.
