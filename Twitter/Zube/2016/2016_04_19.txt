        Looks like one of my predictions became true ... only 3 years late.
        Another pangu test device destroyed. Disconnecting the Xcode debugger by ripping out the cable put it in non-recoverable boot loop.
        So using Xcode debugging with the iOS 9 pangu jailbreak is also Russian roulette.
        Hmm does Twitter nowadays filter mentions with swear words automatically?
        This means my warning is still valid: Pangu9 is not suitable for security researchers. Sooner or later you will get unrecoverable boot loops
        . @DJSundog they might only auto filter mentions from fresh accounts
        That threema comparison chart against whatsapp contains a number of claims against whatsapp that would require deep verversing to verify
        E.g. Did the threema guys reverse whatsapp or how do they know that whatsapp does not mix user input into key entropy?

        NYPD and NY DA Vance have invited the pubic to comment on the importance of strong crypto for preventing crime with the tag #UnlockJustice.
        Strong crypto prevents serious crimes like identity theft, stalking, sabotage and espionage. #UnlockJustice with strong security and crypto.
        Seriously, whoever in the NYPD and the Manhattan DA's office greenlighted this needs to get a different job.
        iPhone encryption helps prevent theft, freeing up NYPD to investigate and solve other crimes. #UnlockJustice
        http://securetheinternet.org  #unlockjustice
        People deserve stronger protection than criminals. Default strong encryption protects civilians against muggers and thieves. #UnlockJustice
        "We've got to take this fight to the Internet!" someone at the DA's office said. Guys, that's the last place you want this fight.

        It's fine if you want to spend more than 40 hours a week doing your job but if you feel compelled to regularly, your workplace is abusive
        Also remember that if you *do* habitually work longer hours you're putting pressure on your coworkers to do the same
        (If you're forced to work longer hours for some reason then it's the fault of the employer/situation and not you!)
        Look at it this way: if everybody worked 80-hour weeks, they wouldn't have any time to play the games you spent 80-hour weeks writing
        (This was Henry Ford's argument for 40-hour weeks)
        @mjg59 In the Gaslighting Economy, they don't force you, they get you to force yourselves and each other.

        People with mobile Intel systems with SATA - try these. Disable TLP if you're using it. Tell me if you get any new SATA errors.
        If you're on Haswell or Broadwell, you *should* get deeper PC states without needing TLP. Maybe on Skylake - currently unclear.

        Pattern of stories about sexism reaching front page, terrible comments, story getting flagged off front page, "what sexism in the workplace"
        If your algorithm results in stories about real problems in your industry being hidden, your algorithm is bad

        Don't work in game dev.https://twitter.com/carlfish/status/721738272070762496 ... 
        All of the supply/demand forces that work so effectively to jack your wages up in SFBA startups? They're reversed in gamedev.
