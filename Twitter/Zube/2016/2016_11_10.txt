DataSciFact

        Canonical examples from robust statistics http://ow.ly/99pDT 
        Why were election polls so wrong? Human factors. Predicting human behavior is far more difficult than QA testing light bulbs.
        Contrary to popular belief, sample size does not need to increase proportionally with population size. 1/3
        For sufficiently large populations, statistical accuracy depends on sample size alone, not on population size. 2/3
        Complications arise when populations are too /small/, not too big. Populations are usually /infinite/ in mathematical statistics. 3/3
        There are many reasons elections are hard to call. Population size is NOT one of them.

        If you weren't born or too young to remember the Reagan years, this is what 1980 felt like.
        Know what we did? We resisted. All sorts of groups and individuals united to fight Reaganism.
        We stopped direct US military intervention in Central America and forced  Reagan's wars underground (leading to Iran/contra).
        We showed solidarity with developing world movements, among other things. All without the use of social media.
        So it can be done, must be done, and hopefully will be done.
        And to those who thought Hillary was the best bet against Trump, buy some comfortable walking shoes. You'll be needed in the streets.
        Liberals are upset, sickened, frightened, and the pain is fresh, I know, but continuing the "Everyone is stupid except us" rants won't help.
        President Donald J. Trump. If that isn't a serious wake-up call to new tactics, I don't know what the fuck is.
        "We, the pundit class, were spectacularly wrong about this election. So, stay tuned for our predictions about President Trump!"
        "Fuck it. I'm gonna Netflix for awhile."

        I'm not convinced this was as much about sexism as it was about racism and homophobia.
        There have historically been many presidents coming into office hated. I don't remember one coming into office feared by his own people.
        What upsets me so much is we have struggled for so many years to overcome discrimination and Trump is running his campaign on bigotry.
        Look on the bright side, none of this will matter once Trump gets the launch codes.

        This is what happens when you don't watch your step when climbing out of the time machine.
        So Donald Trump has managed to destroy both the Bush and Clinton political dynasties.
        Thanksgiving at the Clinton house is going to be a treat. "Hey Bill, remember when you called Obamacare crazy? Pass the gravy."

        May seem trivial, but its my corner: tech companies should immediately go to end-to-end encryption and ponder alternative financial models.
        If you work at Google or Facebook, please start a meaningful internal conversation about giving people tools to scrub their behavioral data.

RegexTip

        Capitalize 'foo' or 'bar' using Perl: s/foo|bar/\u$&/

        I'm still clinging to a bit of hope. Clinton can win PA, MI, MN for 46 votes, and she's always had a shot at NV (5).  AZ? I can pray.

        There are already multiple solid guides on the subject of citizen security against targeted political surveillance. I'll re-review them.

        Immigrants are pouring over our borders and obtaining citizenship so they can vote against Trump! I know, because I'm part of the problem
        I guess if you call people criminals and rapists, threaten to deport them and make their relatives pay for a wall, they get all vote-y
        Panicked Trump appears in sombrero, blackface
        Man, you people who waited til the last minute to research the candidates have SO MUCH reading to do
        Somebody should make an impeachment advent calendar, to count down the days between November 9 and the day after Clinton is sworn in
        So here's my guess at the electoral map. http://www.270towin.com/maps/9lxwm  And my Senate guess is a 52/48 Democratic majority
        Why does Trump, being the largest candidate, not simply eat the others?
        This kind of Pulitzer-worthy journalism doesn't come cheap. Turn off those ad blockers!https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-updates-on-the-2016-election-voting-and-race-results/ken-bone-voted/ ... 
        I went to take a nap after a redeye to Australia, looking forward to waking up to the election result. Seems I got stuck in a nightmare.
        Feeling less confident now about my Alaska forecast
        haven't felt this stress since I was stuck in the middle of the L.A. riots

        Now maybe we can get to the bottom of this email business
        Did we try turning the country off and back on again?
        This was an expensive way to find out that people really don't like Hillary Clinton
        I had a lot of now-useless reporting done for a story on populist Dems' plan to win the transition. TL;DR: Their plan was pretty good.

        Therapists could make a killing if they did surge pricing right now.
        If you want to understand why rape culture is alive in the USA, it's because Trump can admit to sexual assault & still get millions of votes
        So glad Democrats institutionalized a vast and unaccountable national security apparatus that will soon be controlled by a madman.
        Media which got everything wrong will now tell you all the things that will happen as a result of the thing they said wouldn't happen.

        Every single Democratic elected official, pundit, and operative who enabled the nomination of Hillary should be permanently discredited.
        Dems engineered nomination of a DC/Wall St candidate, but Trump won because of the few journos who scrutinized Clinton.

        How bitterly ironic - surrealistic - that a selfish corrupt billionaire becomes the standard bearer for anger over economic unfairness.
        Theory: if you insist investigative journos or @SusanSarandon are why Trump won, you actually may be the reason why Trump won.
        I think the discontent of the American people is far, far greater than the pundits understand.
        "We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America--and I always will." --Hillary
        This is a seriously classy, grown-up concession speech from Clinton
        "I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans."  We should all hope this.

        The rise of Ethereum is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary Clinton.
        Some think that municipalities pursue "smart city" policies. They don't! They pursue other policies - this bla-bla is how they justify them.

        When I start seeing a "probability there will be a 2020 election" meter, I'm going to get REALLY nervous.
        However bad things may seem, at least I can thank god I'm not a pollster.
        Evidently, voters care more about the use of approved government email servers than not being a racist, sexist, impulsive, childish maniac.
        Agree with those saying that it's far too easy to blame Comey, 3rd parties, or any other tactical issue. Reflects deep problems.
        Even the polls that had Clinton winning by a landslide still had a large fraction voting for an unapologetic bigot.
        What frightens me most are not his personal failings, but his evident unconcern for the enormous responsibilities that will soon be his.
        Everything about his campaign suggests that, policy positions aside, he's simply no match for the job. That affects everyone.
        Sheriff Joe Arpaio ousted.
        Here's hoping Ruth Bader Ginsberg has at least four more years in her.
        Several people I know told me they're scrubbing their political opinions from social media. I won't do that, but I understand.
        Works better without context.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/796223452617261057 ... 
        We're about to have a serious test of our institutions. I honestly don't know what to expect.
        Lesson of this (and Brexit): Vote like your vote actually matters.
        Well, that happened.https://twitter.com/AP/status/796253849497571328 ... 
        A lot of reporters have been frantically re-writing the story they had ready to go for tonight.
        This is a seriously strange speech.
        It would be wrong to compare this with 9/11, but the shock and pessimism I'm feeling right now is unmistakably similar.
        I'm told I deserve to be set on fire and thrown off a skyscraper for this.
        I'm less concerned about the small number of people who voted for 3rd party candidates than the large number who voted for the guy who won.

        It should be possible for people to voice their dismay at the political establishment without it also being (effectively) a vote for bigotry
        Remember that bit where Peter Thiel used $1.25 million to argue for  bigotry and you said that was fine? You're a few months late waking up.https://twitter.com/sama/status/796187912681361409 ... 

        Maybe there's a world in which Bernie could have won, and maybe there isn't. But this election was lost by bigotry, and that needs fixing.
        And we don't fix that by ignoring the impact that the tech industry has had in enabling bigotry, from Thiel to Facebook's news algorithms
        We've got plenty of house cleaning to do. Think about whether you're going to spend the next four years doing anything to improve that.
        Techies in the US, we have two months now to think about what kind of data we're collecting and storing on people, and do the right thing

        And if you argued that legislating against surveillance was more important than building good crypto tools: still feeling that way?
        One good thing from today: discovering that there is, in fact, a pool on the roof
        Honestly everybody in tech should be thinking about whether they helped enable this and whether they can do anything to reduce the impact

        It's more than half-way there to achieving its goal, but it needs more states to join up. Make noise and make it happen in your state.
        The NPVIC doesn't need a constitutional amendment. It doesn't need Congress. All it needs is state-level support.
        The Electoral College can be fixed without getting rid of it. And you can help.

        "One voice can change a room, a city, a country, the world"
        Pretty good advice, I was thinking. Then I realized it sounds like a description of a Y Combinator batch, which made me happy.https://twitter.com/hnshah/status/395009025818886145 ... 
        To inspire you to vote, here's a picture by our 4 yo of Hillary defeating Trump.pic.twitter.com/cnCPn4vJJf
        If you do the math, the expected value of a single vote is surprisingly high.https://80000hours.org/2016/11/why-the-hour-you-spend-voting-is-the-most-socially-impactful-of-all/ ... 
        FWIW, here are my comments on the thing you just wrote:
        "I don't like 'social' media because most of my friends are dead!"

        Losing the election doesn't mean giving up.
        Have a good cry tonight. Wake up tomorrow and get to work. Fix it. Fix it.
        I'm going to start by being super nice to everyone Trump has attacked. Which is so many people I think I'll just be nice to everyone.
        I told my 7 yo Hillary lost because she was less charismatic. That's not a sanitized version; it's happened in every election since 1968.
        Praying this is truehttps://twitter.com/tomtomorrow/status/796252787998855168 ... 
        Again, idea that this was some tectonic shift in voting is nuts. Trump not only lost pop vote. He got fewer total votes than Romney did.
        I know politicians routinely fail to deliver on their campaign promises, but this is the first time I've *hoped* one would.
        This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision.pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869

        Ok America. Sort your shit out. I'm having a bourbon and going to bed.
        1) Any other Republican candidate would have walked away with this by now, because Clinton has been so tone deaf.
        2) Any centrist-left Democrat with any charisma would have iced Trump by now.
        3) If Obama could have run again...welp.
        4) I'm not saying Biden would have won, because Biden.
        5) Gary Johnson failed to even be a Nader.

        Saying we're a divided country is understating it. We are 2, possibly 3 countries. We've always been divided. But there was compromise.
        It turns out we need to burn everything down before we can find our center again
        6) we needed a revolutionary voice to unite us around change. Instead we got a marginally competent technocrat and a fascist. Yay.
        7) regardless of who wins, the revolution starts tomorrow.

        So, basically, @NateSilver538, @UpshotNYT, and every other polling/stats analysis outlet was utterly wrong. You do get a salary, right?
        The clock starts now on how long it will take for Trump's more "motivated" supporters to turn on him, because he cannot deliver his promises

        After this year I give a lot of credit to millennials for not Logan's Run-ing everyone in America over 30

        At my polling place in Va. burbs, voter complained the Girl Scouts table was too close to the voting. They measured, then moved it closer
        Thank all 48204 Christs that I have a pentest to work on today to keep my mind off this nauseously spiraling nightmare

        11K votes separating Clinton from Trump in Florida.
        Peter Thiel's wish that the United States become a normal country has been granted. I'm still wistful for the time it was something more.

        Settled up with @Pinboard. He won the bet: Thiel retained influence at YC. Maciej sent proceeds to http://www.domesticworkers.org/  - Seems perfect.
