        Periodic reminder: Modern JIT engines are among the craziest, most impressive, and most impenetrable-for-understanding things ever built.
        Suggestion: Next time you deploy revolutionary tech for the first time militarily, publish what you think the norms ought to be immediately.
        Also, this may imply that you have to stick to these norms yourself. I know it is kinda inconvenient.
        And playing "enemy combatant" semantic games won't fly. The reason GWB got away with it wasn't because he was right, it was because nobody..

        Most misunderstood President is probably Teddy Roosevelt. He did some trust-busting, but he mostly liked monopolies.

        @Bro_Pair FALLON: Does your right arm ever get tired of being up like that?
        Bruce Schneier egregiously oversimplifies the debate over SIGINT agency (like NSA) vulnerability stockpiles.
        There's a productive debate to be had about whether NSA's IAD mission can coexist in the agency as a SIGINT mission. I think: no.
        The notion that NSA's SIGINT mission should be expected to notify Fortinet about management console flaws, though, seems silly.
        Essentially: Schneier is arguing that the US should unilaterally disarm, cease infosec SIGINT.
