        Seems all I hear about in InfoSec is watching logs, responding to false alarms about threats, not engineering against them in first place.
        Feel like I'm missing something here. Are so many companies really so advanced in locking stuff down that a 24/7 SOC is proper resource use?
        Or are the largest voices in InfoSec concerned about Fortune 500 companies and their problems?
        I've spent years ratcheting security configurations, while the vision of InfoSec I'm presented with is looking at SIEM false alarms all day.
        I feel like a fraud, but I'm also not sure how what I'm doing isn't actually just as valuable, or more so, for vast majority of companies.
        @SwiftOnSecurity many build a SOC before they engage those that could build the defenses-disconnect between response specialist and defense.
        @SwiftOnSecurity Security is an emergency for many, and the first stage is sometimes response and knee jerk mandates, without cooperation.
        I want to be cool like all of you, but when I look at cost/benefit it always seems like the boring shit I do is more immediately effective?

        Statement from @torproject on @ioerror.: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/statement 
        I struggle with balancing not wanting to repeat mere rumors with wanting to (quietly or not) protect potential victims. Inherently hard.
        Semi-related:, many years ago, I was stalked by a (then) prominent member of the hacker community. Grateful to have been quietly warned.
        Obama is WAY behind on that gun confiscation and Sharia law implementation program. He better get moving.
        Personality cults as a service.
        I have zero interest in sports, and even less in boxing, but I must say Ali's life story was pretty amazing.
        Also, his life had security significance. The broadcast of the 1971 Ali-Frazier match provided distraction for the Media, PA FBI burglary.

        Swiss reject proposal for guaranteed basic incomehttp://reut.rs/1Y0yXD9 
        pic.twitter.com/8aSKIiSuZm
        (1) A lot of the support for a universal basic income is people seeing what they want in the program. Example:http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american-1464969586 ... 
        (2) Look how this guy says "I support a UBI" then he immediately starts proscribing how people can spend the money.
        (3) He says, $3K annually must be used for health insurance b/c there won't be Medicare anymore. Ok then.
        (4) Then the amount of the UBI disappears as you go up the income scale. So 'universal' isn't 'universal', and 'income' isn't 'income'.
        (5) Basically this WSJ writer's UBI is privatizing Medicare and ending all social welfare spending, plus an expanded EITC.
        (6) The UBI is appealing because as a brand it supposedly appeals to people all over the political spectrum. But...
        (7) An policy appeal based on getting rid of political conflict with vague details should be a red flag.
        (8) A UBI may or may not be a good policy idea, the problem is that it isn't a defined policy idea.

        Look if your response to an accusation is "But I know them, they'd never do that" then maybe ask yourself how well you really knew them
        We spend our lives hiding parts of who we are from others. Often it's stuff like our lack of self confidence or our situational discomfort.
        And sometimes people are hiding the fact that they just don't think consent is something that matters
        If you don't know someone well enough to see them admit the former, why do you think you'd see any evidence of the latter?
        (And do you think someone who knows what they're doing would let you see the latter even if they let you see the former?)

        @SteveD3 DWF is now a recognized CNA, so the numbers look odd but they are legitimate CVE IDs
        @Viss On the plus side, you've got an IoT device that actually checks certs! Thats unexpected!

        Was telling a friend of mine an anecdote about a former co-worker that ended with "and astonishingly did not burn his house down"
        And had it pointed out that many of the anecdotes I tell end with approximately that phrase.

        I don't like to be crude, but Boris Johnson is a fucking cunt.
        A Boris supporter has told me to SHUT UP, while @'ing Boris into my tweet calling him a fucking cunt, thereby exposing him to the tweet.
        I find that unreasonably satisfying.
        Meanwhile, over at The Sun on Sunday, a dog wearing a poker cap reads the comments about his headline and deletes his Twitter account.
        I don't like to be crude, but Nigel Farage is a shit gargling mould spore trapped in the foreskin of a syphilitic wasp cock.
        I'd take John Major a lot more seriously if he hadn't ardently thrust his palpitating love cudgel into Edwina Currie's quivering egg box.
        I don't like to be crude, but Piers Morgan is a rancid sack of horse jizz.
