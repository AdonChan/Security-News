        If it only works on this one phone then there's no need to classify it, is there, geniuses?
        FBI would like to thank the American taxpayers for their assistance in acquiring this new forensics technology.
        The FBI might not have literally had a cracking method to hand, but they absolutely didn't exhaust all avenues as they stated at outset.

        I've walked around with toothaches longer than FBI took to break into this phone.

        We've had Open Office builds take longer than the FBI took to break into this 'unbreakable' iPhone.
        I've debugged C++ apps longer than it took for FBI to hack this phone ...  and that's not saying much.
        FBIs method only works on this specific iPhone. As long as your password isn't 1337.
        Things that lasted longer than FBI's case: E.T. The Video Game
        Things that lasted longer than FBI's case: Microsoft Zune
        If an erection lasts longer than the FBI's case, see a doctor immediately.

        If someone has SecureBoot turned on, why would they install Linux? They already have Windows. That would be like spray-painting your car.
        Although SecureBoot doesn't prevent HDD modifications, it stops message appearing plus I've never seen a GPT-compatible Windows bootkit
        Ironically, people who build their own computers are more at risk to bootkits because they don't know to UEFI-boot the install media.
        .@GossiTheDog SecureBoot prevents the ransomware message from being displayed unless user manually disables it. Hurts ransomware payment.
        @DrPizza @SwiftOnSecurity Likewise, also made sure to enable SecureBoot on my MSI bios (off by default)

        Will we learn...
        What we did learn, as people get access to more & more secure devices, the lengths the FBI will go to break into them when they want to.
        Whether they were telling the truth or not, FBI severely harmed their credibility before any court of law, including the other iPhone cases.
        .@JZdziarski And made it that much harder to explain to other judges why they "can't" get into other devices.
        Note FBI said accessed data. Not unlocked. They were provided a forensic imaging solution too. Unlock would start background tasks.
