        i think bug bounties would serve everyone better if they stopped paying people for bugs and only allowed them to give the money to charities
        you'd get less BS reports, passionate people who want to make a difference.
        'but people should get paid for their work!' fine, then they can sell the bugs in an underground market.

        Here's a joke about British politics:
        Remembering how Ubuntu didn't ship upstream Upstart because the author of a vital patch wouldn't sign the CLA
        CLAs that give upstream more rights than any other contributor are toxic to development and result in a worse product
        Someone who looks exactly like Marty McFly's mum is married to his paternal great-grandfather. SOMETHING'S UP.
        If you're applying to a company that offers unlimited vacation, try to find a way to ask people who work there how much they took last year
        If the answer's less than you'd expect a company to offer, there may be strong social pressure not to take more
        And if you quit, they don't have to pay you any unused days. It sounds great, but it's also a tool that can be used against employees.
        Ideally ask the folks with your title on the team you'll work for. "no policy" means "unwritten policy"https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/752557824228495360 ...
