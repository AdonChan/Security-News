        Teaching security this semester. Thinking of just announcing in 1st lecture that everyone gets an F,; if not satisfied, fix it yourself.
        Note: I'm not actually doing that.
        It does suggest some interesting policies. E.g., It's cheating if you have someone else change your grade for you.
        People are now telling me various reasons this is a bad idea.
        At its best, cloud security uses the hard-learned lessons of traditional computer security to make different, far worse, mistakes.

        Modern trade agreements are for the most part not really trade agreements anymore. They are investment agreements.
        What is weird about the ISDS issue is that there is actually no policy rationale for this system. Normal courts are fine.
        There isn't a reason to have extra-legal global tribunals. Foreign investors don't demand it. It doesn't do anything. It's just a grift.
        Like, pharma patent system has become absurd, but there's an underlying rationale. Patents induce research. Agree or not, there's a reason.
        Nearly every bad policy structure has a justification which sounds reasonable, even if the policy has morphed out of control.
        But not ISDS. It's just 'we need a separate secret unaccountable global justice system only for corporations because reasons'.
        It's also not even the biggest corporations using this system. It's often predatory smaller pools of capital, vulture funds.
