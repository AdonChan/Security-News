        There's no policy position Trump could take that would cost him the election. He mocked 3 decades of GOP orthodoxy, then beat 16 challengers
        Here's what sure liberal victory plus low voter turnout looks like: it looks like Brexit. It looks like the FARC peace deal.

        Right now Twitter is full of women telling similar stories. It's happened to women you know, whether they're your wife or daughter or not.
        If you think Trump just needs to apologise, you're telling them that you care more about his words than his actions. They'll remember.
        And you're also continuing the tacit support that's given to other men who behave this way, and the harm to women that comes from it
        (Of course, it's worth remembering that this isn't inherently a political problem - the left perpetuate this shit just as much as the right)

        So, here's a thing to consider in reference to 'dumps' of documents - 
        See, the one thing that gave wikileaks credibility -at first- [before they became overtly political] is that they appeared to have...
        ...a very strong ethic against modifying the documents that they released.
        And, further, with smaller dumps like we used to get a few years ago, it's easier to determine the likelihood of any individual doc...
        ...having been tampered with, modified, or what have you.
        These truly massive ones we're getting now?
        So it's comparatively easier to hide 'damning' documents in a trove of 'legit' ones, with the 'legit' ones giving a veneer of legitimacy.
        [ I feel like there's probably already an intel community term for this, but I don't know what it'd be ]
        So when you see a huge trove of docs dumped willy-nilly, you should probably be suspicious of anything you find within that's...spicy.
        Because a large corpus of benign-but-accredited docs will give plausibility to modified or otherwise faked docs within the trove.
        And the larger the dump, the easier it is to put something plausibly into 'em. It stands out less.
        Beware large dumps, especially those that have sat for a long time before being made public. It only takes a few minutes to gin summat up.
        @munin that would be an interesting NLP project: what is the relative freq. of spicy vs mundane emails. Enron corpus good for that.
        @munin Now I want an Antiques Roadshow for Data Dumps "What do you know about the dump?" "I found it on an SD card in an old laptop bag..."

        Not to claim I'm not evil. Which I might or not be. Point is: blindly trusting anon dumps is silly, even if data looks legit.
        Everything which can't be reliably cross-verified, might be considered a "hint" at best, but - more likely - a misdirection.

        To be clear, Billy Bush was 34 and Trump was 59 when they made those horrific comments. It wasn't frat talk. These are adults.

        3/4 hold up @Snowden as a privacy hero while also happily sharing hacked emails of private citizens. If you're going to cherry-pick which-
