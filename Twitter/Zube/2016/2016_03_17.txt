        There are so many automotive cybersecurity conferences, I can't keep them straight.  Does that mean cars are secure now?  Are we safe?
        Maybe folks should spend more time securing cars and less time talking about how we should secure cars.
        While everyone is talking about how seriously they take car security and how important it is,I'll be home doing security research on my jeep
        If you want to actually make cars secure, manufacturers need to be transparent.  Release a document describing your security architecture.
        Start an open discussion.  How is it designed, what hurdles does it present, what are its weaknesses, what compensations for those are there
        How is the code tested, validated?  How are updates deployed?  Are they signed?  How are attacks detected and responded to?
        Microsoft releases SDLC gives talks at conferences, Google releases (most) code.  Even Apple releases security documentation for iOS.

        AceDeceiver is a great example of how a cryptographic "leash" can be broken by criminals.
        Not only does AceDeceiver break its leash, but it uses a deeply embedded DRM design flaw to do it, making it difficult to fix quickly.

        So, let me get this straight: The US capital's subway system is shutting down tomorrow for a full day, according to anonymous sources.
        Because making an official announcement of something like this would be too obvious?
        URGENT Entire Metro system to shut down for at least 29 hours starting at midnight to check for faulty cables, say 2 Metro officials. #WMATA
        All Metrorail service will be suspended Wed., March 16, for emergency inspections: http://tinyurl.com/h34ph56  #wmata pic.twitter.com/YEXPL1cm2s

        Is there some way we can take a plea bargain here and just accept Trump as President of Florida or something?
        Sorry Florida, but you need to take one for the team here... https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/709920708961419265 ... 
        From this morning's email:
        Just noticed NIST withdrew the Clipper std (FIPS185) last October, and is de-approving the Skipjack cipher. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-175/sp800-175b_draft.pdf ...  [pdf]
        I wonder what happened to the Clipper key escrow database. Lost maybe? But TSD3600E has 768bit DH, so no real point in escrow today.
        I suspect breaking 768bit DH would be faster than retrieving the escrowed keys, even if the escrow DB still exists.
        So I'm still not going to be using my old TSD for anything too sensitive, even without key escrow.
        Just wanted to let everyone know I won't be submitting this semester's grades until the inauguration. The next president should decide.
        As an engineer, when I hear people worrying about something happening because of a "mere technicality", I become confused and sad.

        Interesting: remote code execution in git client & server < 2.7.1 - potential Bitbucket/Gitlab/Github impact? https://marc.ttias.be/oss-security/2016-03/msg00180.php ... 
        This has the potential to be huge if someone finds an implementation for it ...
        There are a couple of projects that let you convert Linux manpages to html (man2html, groff), but they all generate butt ugly HTML.
        Hard to template or just work with in general. Anyone know of any recent projects that allow manpage conversions to HTML?
        The potential impact of the git < 2.7.2 remote code execution (client + server): https://ma.ttias.be/remote-code-execution-git-versions-client-server-2-7-1-cve-2016-2324-cve-2016%E2%80%912315/ ... 
        ^ reminder for folks in different timezones or normal sleep cycles: git client + server are vulnerable to a remote code execution.
        Gitlab has updated packages available, if you run a self-hosted git repository, start patching.
        This also makes you wonder if any libgit* implementations would be vulnerable.
        TIL: Github has a (cool looking) security bug bounty site: https://bounty.github.com/  pic.twitter.com/rm03iM0S5N
        Lovely how much control you have about this as a user. Thanks, Slashdot. pic.twitter.com/J2sFXXTsIN
        @mattiasgeniar FYI, the IUS project has git2u RPMs.  2.7.2 is in the stable repo, and 2.7.3 is in the testing repo.
        Better news still: this git RCE vulnerability got disclosed before patches were available. https://marc.ttias.be/oss-security/2016-03/msg00195.php ...

        News orgs: Please turn off adblockers.
        So, here's an interesting question of liability. If you are forced to run code to consume media, is there liability? https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/710137698032476160 ... 
        We can probably relate this to the Sony Rootkit - remember that one? CD installed a rootkit onto people's computers to prevent copying?
        So if news orgs are demanding you allow arbitrary executable code to run, does that make them liable for harm caused by said code?
        I'm genuinely interested here; are there any lawyers who can clear this up?
        Breach lawsuits are commonplace. When will an enterprising lawyer take on class-action malware damages?  https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/710137698032476160 ... 
        @munin Fortune has a very broad LIMITATION OF LIABILITY in their TOU. Whether that would hold up in court, I don't know.
        @munin A related question is whether that disclaimer of liability (even in case of negligence) would prevent them from damages, *anyway*
        @munin They also have an "Indemnification" clause that says you'll pay all their cots "arising in any way from your of the Web Site"
        @munin ... Which is kinda terrifying but I'd think unenforceable just as a TOU (as opposed to contract), but I am of course IANAL

        AP calls #OHPrimary for Hillary. Only 3% of election day in but she's crushing 66-33. Big relief after MI
        Guess what, Dems? Clinton is your nominee.
        HRC very clearly learned lesson of '08, which is you have to play for delegates, not states.
        40% reporting, Foxx leads Alvarez 60-27%.
        Starting to believe you cannot in fact help CPD conceal an unjustified police shooting for over a year and keep your elected office.
        55% reported, Fox over Alvarez 61-27.
        Yes, actions have consequences: Anita Alvarez is trailing by an amazing 120,000 votes with more than half of the city of Chicago reporting.
        Bye, Anita.

        When politicians like @WhiteHouse (supposedly a constitutional law expert) refer to technicalities, they mean what most of us call "rights."
        Crazy thing I believe about crypto: the FBI is right to want universal key escrow, and the public is right to refuse them.
        It's surprising how much good it does your blood pressure not to start from the premise that the DOJ is a bunch of monsters.
