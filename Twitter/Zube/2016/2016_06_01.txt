        Criticizing a free OSS project w/o contributing misses the point. But that's how critical security feedback looks like. Hard to reconcile.
        On top of that, security feedback often triggers fear of the unknown, making a defensive reaction even more likely.
        But security is not visible to most users, so feedback from those who look into it is fundamental to keep all others safe.
        How do we stop important security feedback from looking like the more and more common entitled OSS hating?
