        I see people criticizing the http://neveragain.tech  pledge because it's words, not actions. But a public committment like this is action.
        My favorite critique of the http://nevergain.tech  pledge: you signed it, but your bosses went to Trump tower!https://twitter.com/amelielamont/status/809148403485589504 ...

        2016: Obama promises retaliation against Russia "at a time and place of our choosing"
        "There has never been a serial exaggerator in recent U.S. politics like the president-elect." Why can't the Washington Post just say "liar"?
        I wonder if CNN's nuclear war game plan is still to play a VHS tape of "Nearer My God To Thee"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/06/cnn-apocalypse-video-nearer-my-god-to-thee ... 
        "U.S. Protests China's Seizure of Naval Drone in Open Seas." Remember that a very similar situation was the big event in early GWB days
        Censorship is [REDACTED] the answer
        I like the "Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda" doc, but it has one terrible piece of advice. Do NOT use Facebook to organize
        There's no good Facebook alternative for organizing lots of people, unfortunately. "Signal, but for mailing lists" is something we need
        My use case is this: I have a few hundred interested people who want to get occasional updates on tech solidarity events, outside of email
        I'm sure there's some obvious combination of Tor, rainbow tables, the blockchain and ham radio that I'm missing
        @Pinboard Meshnets are about due for a revival, right?
        On bad days, I think Signal is a CIA project to push people away from good encryption through UI torture. We need to throw money at Moxie
        @Pinboard I'm not afraid to spout a dumb idea on twitter, so what about something more fluid than email like slack? (I know the downsides)
        Slack has the same problem as Facebook. Plus I heard Slack is just a bunch of failed game developers /cc @anton612

        Der Firma @cyberport_de muss es besonders gut gehen wenn man diese Behandlung von Kunden betrachtet.
        Ironischerweise geht es hier um 2 Bestellungen bei @cyberport_de an die gleiche Lieferadresse. Die eine ist freigegeben, die andere nicht
        So Bestellungen bei @cyberport_de storniert. Besser woanders kaufen.
        Sieht so aus als wÃ¼rde @Cyberport_de meinen Widerruf einfach ignorieren
        Man muss nur mit dem Kopf schÃ¼tteln. Paket 1 wurde soeben von @cyberport_de an mich verschickt. FÃ¼r Identisches Paket 2 ...

        Shortest scientific paper ever published in serious journal. Zero words. 1974. http://bit.ly/1HgSRDh pic.twitter.com/qU2iCgxzIX
        I'm repeating the attached, because while it's profoundly unsatisfying, it's also about the most we can say.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/801837301206831109 ... 
        The only thing I'm sure of here is that if you're sure, you're wrong.
        It would be extremely misguided to conclude insecure voting system are no big deal because there are other ways to influence elections.
        Were voting systems tampered with during the last election? Probably not, but I don't know. You don't either.
        So while voting system security may not be the most significant thing with the election, it's not a non-issue, either. And it will be back.
        My sense is we've not yet reached the tipping point where attackers tool up to attack voting systems. Honeymoon will eventually end, tho.
        One problem is anyone who points out problems is dismissed as sore looser from whatever the most recent election was. This is non-partisan.
        Also, important to remember the threat isn't just national races. It's also someone selling city counsel seats.

        Opened support case at $VENDOR to change e-mail address;
        Pro tip to corporates: allow a user to change their effing e-mail address, don't spend engineering hours processing cases and callcenters.
        That must have caused them a few hundred $$ just in case follow-up and in engaging the callcenter to follow-up. Wasted energy.
        The poor engineer in their side probably has to write a report about that case, too.
        Real time follow-up: the engineer on my case just sent a new email, informing me that the callcenter confirmed the case can be closed.
        No wonder they're expensive as fuck.
        Haha: " I will now proceed with the administrative case closure" -> looks like someone *is* going to be typing a report.

        VHF and higher freq induced cataracts are a -very- well known issue with people who work with radio.
        It's been an issue for decades now, and is part of the reason why RF exposure limits are as they are.
        And up until now, nobody was fool enough to stick an antenna in their eye on a regular basis.
        Long story short: strapping a gun sight to a yagi is a very deeply stupid idea and any regular users will get cataracts in a few years.
        The -right- way to do it would be to align a camera with it, and then aim using the video feed from a safe distance.
        But please, -please- do not go sticking antennas in your eye.
