        Hillary supporters still blame Nader for Bush in 2000. While false, I  kinda wish it wasn't. (1/2)
        Not only did I vote for Nader, I wrote for him. I doubt that fucked over Gore/Lieberman, but a boy can dream. (2/2)
        How awful is Trump? If the general election was Trump v. McCain or Romney, liberals would choose the latter, piously justifying their vote.

        The openness of a company's products is inversely proportional to market share. Hence why Microsoft is opening up and Apple is so closed.

        Some characterize this as needs of FBI vs. tech companies. That's wrong. It's tech users (e.g., all of us).

        And it is depressing to watch conservatives laud a decision like that. Because legislating from the bench is okay when you hate the rules.
