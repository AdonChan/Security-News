        In HBO's ALL THE WAY, Bryan Cranston solidly conveys LBJ's bluster, bullying, paranoia, and legislative genius.pic.twitter.com/2P9ycxSXC1
        LBJ lends himself to caricature, yet Cranston lands just short of that. His LBJ is seductive and repellent.
        He twists arms to the breaking point while smiling and promising a better tomorrow.
        Bradley Whitford's Hubert Humphrey is a surprisingly good impression, capturing Humphrey's nasal whine and incessant hand wringing.
        If Humphrey was as malleable in real life as he's depicted in ALL THE WAY, I wonder what kind of president he would have made.
        We now need a warts-and-all depiction of the Clinton White House, a presidential saga worthy of HBO, with a sequel already in the works.

        I find Gawker repellant, too, but I ultimately care more about press freedom than the freedom of billionaires to exact capricious revenge.
        (I reserve the right to change my values once I become a bitter, petty and capricious billionaire.)
        Now people are telling me I'm wrong, because I don't understand that Gawker is repellant.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/735652629800464384 ... 
        Note that I'm not saying Gawker deserved to win (or lose) this particular suit. The outcome of the suit isn't the troubling part to me.
        ... what I'm troubled by is that this strategy - targeted expensive lawsuits - could easily shut down far less unsavory media orgs.
        The fact that you're a billionaire and those people who wronged you aren't seems like pretty good revenge all by itself.
        Gawker's vileness aside, the implications of billionaire grudge-funding at scale might be worth thinking about before applauding too hard.
        Billionaires should focus on important things, like making life a living hell for my high school gym teacher. No, I haven't forgotten.
        One thing I seriously don't understand about Thiel's funding the Gawker case is why the normal contingency fee model wouldn't have worked.
        (Actually, my HS gym teacher was a perfectly nice fellow by gym teacher standards. Billionaire friends: call off the plan, please.)

        I love the original Ghostbusters as much as the next person, but let's face it: the movie is a total right-wing fantasy trip.
        The next big scandal on the verge of exploding is the small biz loansharking game. It's Boiler Room part II, with unplayable debt this time.
        All the office buildings on Long Island that used to house the bucket shop brokers are now hosting lending boiler rooms. Next-gen punks.
        The media and government haven't picked up on it yet. It's becoming an epidemic. Stay tuned.
        Comcast just raised prices 25% this year, after a 30% hike last year. There are no other broadband providers in our area. #MonopolyProblem
        There's no great mystery to dropping productivity. There's no competition anymore. #Antitrust
        No startup formations because (a) there are virtually no real markets where startups can enter, (b) student debt crushing would-be startups.
        And incumbent players do not have to innovate b/c they can just buy patents or Other People's Research and play pricing games.
        R&D in pharma has collapsed even as prices have skyrocketed. That's an example.
        And innovation that does happen is simply rolled out to extend the monopolies of giant incumbents.
        This is all essentially contra U.S. policy from 1790s to 1980, which pushed decentralization via antitrust and competition policy. Anyway.
        The most profitable companies sit on cash, everyone else is bleeding it. Falling productivity is such a mystery!http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/05/20/growing-wealth-inequality-hits-americas-largest-corporations/#2fa4d49253cc ... 
        Since IO economists don't like studying concentration, we have to use these weird tools called "eyes" and "common sense" to figure this out.
        Also the 'robots are coming to take our jobs' and 'productivity collapsing' stories are not super consistent.
        A: Lock everyone down with patents, poverty, shit jobs, monopolies, and debt. 
        Here's a counter-example that makes the point. You know why we live in a golden age of TV? Because there's a lot of new competition.
        Because the over-the-top market protected by net neutrality rules exists, independent production companies and creators can flourish.
        I'm shocked to discover that billionaires like to control the media.
        Wait. Are you telling me if that if you have a ton of money that you can influence what people think by using that money? That's crazy.

        This while podcasting thing is pretty exciting. I still suck at it from what I'm concerned, but it's fun. Gets me out of my comfort zone.
        The world of audio, editing and planning of talks involves so much more than 'just blogging'. Takes a lot more planning & commitment.
        You can write a blogpost in a couple of days, on and off, but recording needs a single 1-2h stretch without disruptions.
        Mind you, having a 2yo doesn't help in the planning.
