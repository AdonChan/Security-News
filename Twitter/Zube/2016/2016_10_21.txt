        Fortunately Trump will pull us out of this moral impasse by saying or doing something even worse, and Thiel will write another check
        It's rare to see a reductio ad absurdum argument about the boundaries of political discourse play out in real life, but this...  is...  2016!!!!!

        People who are bemoaning the lack of a climate change question--was that really going to decide you for or against Trump?
        The nice thing about climate change is that it will put itself on the political agenda whether people want it to or not.
        The not-so-nice thing about climate change is when it turns our planet into Venus II
        Lot of good points made on both sides tonight! How do they ever expect us to decide?

        1) The video is a perfect example of 'poisoning the well':  6 seconds in: "All the ideas we are talking about today are terrible ideas"
        2) The rest of it is: There were a bunch of dumb, racist ideas about geography a while ago, so we can *never discuss geography again*.
        1) To be fair, the section from 7:54 to 8:24 on Europe vs China in GG&S I also find mostly unconvincing in the book.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdd9y3U9iSI&feature=youtu.be&t=7m20s ... 
        2) And I think we are living in the 2nd most probable world: Asia was most likely to win and Europe just got lucky this roll of the dice.

        Wires all have same lede. This is AFP: "Donald Trump refused Wednesday to say that
        Decision 2016: 
        6/ Gore told / implored his supporters to accept the unprecedented SCOTUS decision.
        Remember all the violence and civil unrest when Al Gore attempted to seize power in January 2001?
        Demand recounts if you think there was an error. That's the process. But accept the final outcome. That's democracy.
        Any adults with even a shred of decency who are left in Trump's operation, have a duty is to get him to walk this back. He invited violence.
        So I optimistically tweet this right before they get to the part with him refusing to promise to accept the legitimacy of the election.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/788917440659030018 ... 

        Notable that the "I'll keep you in suspense" remark wasn't a heated response to bait from Clinton, but to a predictable moderator question.
        In other words, totally un-forced error.
        Nominations for the 2017 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies are open! https://www.petsymposium.org/award/cfn.php 
        I have to admit, "I might not accept the election results" was a pretty effective way to get everyone to stop talking about sexual assault.
        To get our minds off this, Trump's next statement:  "Puny Earthlings! My platform is actually a cookbook."
        "OK, sure, he promises to colonize the planet and use us for food, but it's high time someone did something to shake up the system."
        More on the Martin NSA case.  Still no clear motive, no clear link to Shadow Brokers.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/harold-martin-nsa.html ... 
        New stmt from @SenJohnMcCain: "in every previous election, the loser congratulates the winner and calls them, 'my president.'"pic.twitter.com/7IIbh4pqfY
        Whew. Trump assures us he will "totally accept the results" as long as he wins. Glad he clarified that.
        This is not just about how Trump will react to losing, but his supporters, some of whom regard "2nd Amendment remedies" as a next step.
        Can Trump's supporters actually seize power if he loses? Of course not. But there could be serious violence.

        Things are happening all over the world. Important things. Interesting things. Dangerous things. Not everything is related to the election.
        Our frameworks for understanding power are just so silly. Take this article on how Netflix can't sell in China.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-the-latest-us-tech-company-to-fail-to-conquer-china-2016-10-19?mod=mw_share_twitter ... 
        As opposed to saying the Chinese Communist Party doesn't want American content companies selling to their people, the article says...
        ... tThe country's regulatory and legal framework has failed to keep pace with its economic boom..." Uh, no.
        We're so unused to another empire having power and seeking to displace us that we literally do not have the language to describe it.
        To take an example closer to home, let's go to Puerto Rico. It is a slow motion disaster.
        The trends we see in the election of 2016 were set in motion years, even decades ago. Punditry is just 3 year olds chasing a soccer ball.
        @matthewstoller @MarketWatch "Famously tricky to navigate" is both misleading and an understatement of intense proportions
        In the UK, there is a fascinating and weird political realignment as they deal with #Brexit and conservatives sort of embrace workers.

        TONIGHT on @TheDailyShow at 11ep: @RollingStone contributing editor @mtaibbi. #DailyShow
        Chris Wallace: it's okay to hoot and holler during primary season, but this is serious.
        Penetrating analysis by Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash: Trump will either take the high road, take the low road, or do something in between.
        Already having fantasies about Wallace being torn apart by hyenas. Usually I don't get that until minute 20.
        HRC: I've lived in some dumb places and I get the gun thing.
        So far this feels like a throwback to every predictable/boring Republican-Democrat debate from the pre-Trump era.
        The inevitable, "No, you're a Turd sandwich!" moment.
        Smoke rising out of Mt. Trump. Time to flee the village.

        Surprisingly, the first naked ploy for Sanders voters comes from HRC and not Trump.

        Second craven play for Sanders voters goes to Trump.
        Chris Wallace snickers at the spectacle of Republican and Democratic nominees fighting over the approval of Bernie Sanders.

        As I've tweeted/blogged often, Trump's populist conspiracies theories are a threat to democracy that means you should NEVER vote for him...
        The Republic has never -- NOT EVER -- had a POTUS candidate who up front said he might not respect the people's verdict.

        The problem with this statement is that we have absolutely no way of meaningfully evaluate neither the cost, nor the price.https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi/status/788720685120155649 ... 
        E.g. even the most challenging exploit, once developed (and deployed) suddenly becomes much cheaper to use another time. (1/)
        (2/) But defenders often can't know the exploit's "market" value dropped significantly. They continue to guesstimate the value incorrectly.
        So, the @dinodaizovi's "law" might be true, but one needs to know "all the facts about the universe" in order to meaningfully evaluate it :)
        @rootkovska $100k to compromise my Android may not be worth it, but at 100k+ devices you break even at $1 asset value per device.

        Donald Trump now has 12.6 million twitter followers. I wonder how many fewer he'll have after all the relieved unfollows on November 9th.

        One negative thing about political writing is that literally all of it is a lie

        Because the world is a super weird place I bet this is the first debate where Trump wins in the polls.
        PALIN just now to reporters: Trump will only accept a "legitimate" election and anything else would betray those who "died" for freedom
        Here's how Trump reacts when he loses an Emmy, the Iowa caucus, a primary, and polls. So yeah, he seems fit for the presidency. #DebateNightpic.twitter.com/1LGEbOtuhA

        I genuinely don't believe I will lose this bet.https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/788954877296803840 ... 
        If Thiel sticks by Trump after he openly declared himself a fascist AND @sama sticks by Thiel, I lose $1000. Otherwise: @Pinboard out $0.50.
        That is how much I think @Pinboard is wrong about how cynical @sama is.
        When I win, I want to reiterate, Maciej has to give my my fifty cents on one of those gigantic checks they use when you donate to charity.
        I say @sama will want to look back in 50 years and say that in every way he possibly could, he opposed the rise of American Fascism.
        It's still the entire front page of CNN, FWIW.
        If I lose the bet to @tqbf, it will be a critical setback in the buildup to laundry day. But if I win, there will be so many clean socks!
        He has an obvious gift for this. Master of the head-fake.pic.twitter.com/HMrNw2bH3r
        wait i bet what now?
        Victim blaming of "Podesta's so dumb for clicking links hahaha" stuff is BS. I would have fell for some of these. And likely so would you.
        BREAKING: Donald Trump says he will `totally accept' the results of the presidential election `if I win'

        By constantly crying wolf, Trump has cheapened the reality that certain aspects of American politics actually are rigged.
