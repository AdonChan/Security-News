        IoT devs requiring online vendor services are consumer-unfriendly, but at least might get taken off net when vendor dies & patches stop.
        Worst case is where vendor dies, but devices stay online in a degraded (and insecure) state, waiting to be compromised.
        What an idiotically fragile world we're creating.
        BREAKING: Thing everyone warned would happen, happened.
        Buildings with thousands of obsolete, unpatched IoT lightbulbs will become the Internet equivalent of superfund sites.

        Good quotes in this piece.https://www.ft.com/content/45fd9800-988a-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae ... 
        That AT&T/Time Warner are even daring to propose this deal suggests companies think antitrust review is a jokehttps://twitter.com/ddayen/status/789958903857414144 ... 
        The least consumer-friendly word in the AT&T-Time Warner deal: "bundling".
        AT&T is already prioritizing its own video content. That's what this Time Warner merger is about. http://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-mobility-ceo-lurie-defends-carrier-s-directv-zero-rating-no-regulatory-concerns ... 
        Good luck being a small video competition and getting through the walled gardens that will emerge in the wake of this merger.
        You know how movies are all Avengers-Star Wars terrible and TV is good? Well this merger means that TV will go the route of movies.
        "Shares in Discovery, Scripps Networks and AMC Networks also rose on Friday on the expectation that more consolidation was coming..."
        You will be able to get CNN video content on your phone, for free. But want someone else's news video? Cha-ching!
        Want to follow live-streamed protests or a candidate's live-stream instead of CNN commentators? Good luck with that.
        It's tempting to pretend like there are options. But there aren't. Verizon is buying content too.https://twitter.com/lesapdavis/status/790180781188640768 ... 
        The ATT-Time Warner merger can be stopped. And if it is stopped, it will reorient the media landscape in a good way. If not...
        I enjoyed Avengers. I didn't enjoy Avengers version 23. The point is there's no variety. It's all Avengers.https://twitter.com/RyanAClarke/status/790180819360894976 ... 
        The other fascinating problem, which is not going to be acknowledged, is how much leverage this gives the Chinese Communist Party over AT&T.
        Time Warner will do anything to sell entertainment products in China. And the CCP knows that. http://www.uscc.gov/Research/directed-hollywood-edited-china-how-china%E2%80%99s-censorship-and-influence-affect-films-worldwide ... 
        zero rating is going to be THE issue in this merger, and yet, the cos. may end up avoiding a full fcc reviewhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/790179912988565504 ... 
        Really appreciate @brianstelter covering the Time Warner - ATT deal. It needs that type of coverage.
        Time Warner isn't an internet provider. That's Time Warner Cable. Different companies, same name. It's confusing.https://twitter.com/HBK112/status/790184851467079680 ...

        Please note: it wasn't IoT that broke the Internet yesterday, it was default credentials, outsourcing, and single points of failure
        @ErrataRob 1) the NSA would rather exploit those 500,000 insecure cameras to spy on people not fix them, 2) you don't need the NSA to do it.
        Welcome to the future where your crockpot is capable of state sponsored cyber crimes.
        @munin @mhoye Most consumers don't even know there's a question. 99% of the population complained about bad Wifi yesterday, not botnets.
        .@thomassturm @mhoye Precisely. If something has an unclear causal step, people will blame the thing they -can- see.
        .@thomassturm @mhoye For most people, "IoT Botnet spewing from their toaster" will look precisely like "damned ISP is slow again"
        .@thomassturm @mhoye And given how terrible ISPs are that's probably the more reasonable assumption.

        @munin @mhoye This stuff is impossible to explain to laypeople. "You have to send your baby-monitor back to Amazon because botnet." "WTF?"
        .@thomassturm @mhoye This is why I kind of have a lot of sympathy for the 'brick them' crowd - because that, at least, is a clear cause.

        Judge was only allowed to consider whether Martin posed a flight risk, but said he posed a clear danger if he was released.

        History of Chicago, abridged 
        "$100 an hour is more than our CEO makes so I'm not sure we can budget $1500 for this"
        If you do consulting work and bill hourly, it's possible that no single tip will make you as much money as "SWITCH TO BILLING DAILY" will.
        I find FFTF to be hugely dishonest. Today, they're verging on comical. 
        I though CISA/CISPA was a pretty dumb bill, although nothing resembling the calamity FFTF claimed it was. Mostly: just thought it pointless.
        (Unlike 99.999% of FFTF's audience, I actuall read CISPA and CISA, which are extremely short bills. You can too.)
        Literally the one place I thought CISA might have some utility was with DDOS mitigation: would allow USG to clearinghouse ISP DDOS reports.
        The competing bills that CISA displaced did nothing about DDoS. Rather: they proposed req't that infosec people get certification.
        What was on the table was a mandate for third-party audits structured mostly to benefit companies like Raytheon and SAIC.
        Of course, if any of CISA's competing bills were seriously on the table, FFTF would be misrepresenting them as well.
        TL;DR: you will learn more about information security by hitting yourself on the head with a copy of "CISSPs for Dummies" than from FFTF.
        (FFTF is "Fight For The Future", an advocacy group started during the SOPA fight).
        Audio engineers bill daily. Stop billing hourly to build software.https://twitter.com/Herodedalus/status/790208935919837185 ... 
        Endace sold packet capture tools to repressive governments. They deserve the attention. But so does Cisco. Nobody is writing that article.
        A confidential memo obtained by the Intercept showed Endace billing GCHQ 1/100th of GCHQ's Post-It budget for packet capture cards.
        This just in: packet capture cards can be used to facilitate spying.
        It's going to be an exciting day on the Internet when The Intercept learns what a SPAN port is.
