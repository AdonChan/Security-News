        That Michigan bill http://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/billintroduced/Senate/htm/2016-SIB-0927.htm ...  doesn't make sense to me.
        it says: A PERSON SHALL NOT INTENTIONALLY ACCESS ... AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OF A MOTOR VEHICLE TO WILLFULLY... ALTER... THE MOTOR VEHICLE.
        When you turn the steering wheel, you are accessing an electronic system to willfully alter the motor vehicle.  Happily IANAL.

        I would like to see something like this as a parental control option.pic.twitter.com/heYqLNJieD
        Configurator could supervise a child's device, but parents don't understand the user interface. Apple could simplify it for average folk.
        Let iOS allow the user to add multiple passcodes, keep separate copies of keybag keys entangled with each code. Done.  Spouse/parent access.
        Let the controls choose when an alternative passcode can be used; immediately or after 48 hours, or 30 days of inactivity.
        If Apple would encrypt iCloud backups, spouses/parents could securely back up to the cloud with a recovery password the spouse/parent has.
        Today, Apple could give parents a tool if they add iCloud changes to the parental restrictions, so I can force iCloud backup on for kids.
        Really all of Configurator should be taken and wrapped in a coherent UI for average parents to use to manage children's devices.

        The wonderful thing about encrypted messengers is that (usually) account takeover doesn't give the attacker your full message history.
        In other words, just removing the incentive for providers to log messages is already a huge privacy bonus, even if the encryption sucks.
