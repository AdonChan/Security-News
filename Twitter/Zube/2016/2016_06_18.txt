        The interesting thing about security flaws with cars is that it will lead to direct monetizable impact via car theft or crash liability.
        So there's no need to hype the impacts of a remote unlock flaw. The cars will get stolen and the company can decide cost trade off of fixing
        Human impact of car vuln is another thing. 1 life impacted from security vuln is too many, but models for fixes/recalls may say otherwise.
        It would be smart of insurance agencies to track unfixed vulns in car unlock systems. They pay for theft, should incorporate this into model
        .@spoofzu sounds crazy at first but insurance currently offers discount for plugin that records driving patterns, why wouldn't they expand?

        Most sites don't need HPKP right now. The ones that need it, _really_ need it.
        This will sound glib and Ryan Sleevi will hate me, but the gigantic epic footgun risk is a sign that HPKP is working.
        Don't HPKP your blog or your web store.
        Oh, look, a real, live security risk that _isn't entirely externalized_. Something must be done!
        Real quick, and sorry for abusing Twitter like this, but here goes:
        A popular thing we did at Matasano for candidates was to buy books for candidates, sight-unseen, on first contact: "skim these first".
        (All candidates got TAOSSA, Tangled Web, and WAHH)
        Anyways: more firms should do that, and if Starfighter reps your firm, and you let us find out what the right books are... 
        ...  then you already do, whether you want to or not, because we'll be buying the books for candidates.
        Sorry about that. Announcement felt smaller than a blog post. TOO BIG FOR ONE TWERP. Back to snark that only I find funny.
        "I must do nothing by your orders. I am gluten-free!"
        Funny, that.https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/743906853852188672 ... 
        Google pays a 50% bonus for patches. But the black market would pay a 50000000% bonus for that patch!
        I'm reading this and just can't believe "the DAO" was ever a thing.http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/17/thoughts-on-the-dao-hack/ ... 
        This'll be in a book someday, as an example "dumbest contract clauses".pic.twitter.com/OwHs9BaJim
        Again, as someone who has not been following along:
        Ended up getting drugged at a party at E3 by drinking a drink intended for a girl I was hanging out with. This industry can be super shitty.
