        People made the big mistake to try to "fix" #wassenaar by fixing language instead of rejecting it completely.
        It would also have helped if EU countries would actually enforce #wassenaar cause most infosec companies in EU are in violation right now.
        Who knew that you can teach subtraction in a way that will make it impossible to usehttps://twitter.com/sergeybratus/status/810981311439601666 ... 
        Let's be clear: real world effect of wassenaar is destruction of infosec companies and EU being proud that shady companies moved away
        But as long policy/lawyers keep suggesting that infosec customers are mostly evil regimes there is really no point in discussions.
        Most infosec customers are harmless but the overhead and costs to get export licenses for them will just not be bearable for small companies
        Is it too late to change profession and becom an export control lawyer? Asking for a friend.

        Among the things the USSS does is screen - and keep records of - those who visit the president. Perhaps that's why he wants his own people.
        I know people who are scrubbing their soc media, etc, of political content. I understand the fear, but I won't do it myself. It's giving up.
        I'm fortunate to be in a position of sufficient privilege that I'm more safe & comfortable prominently asserting my rights than many.
        In the months and years ahead, I think those who can afford to have a responsibility not to self-censor, for the sake of those who can't.
        Realistically, this isn't going to be about rounding up liberals into camps. It will be about not protecting them from reprisal.
