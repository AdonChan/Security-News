        Little considered fact. Millennial first-time voters are the generation of kids who lived through the foreclosure wave of 2006-2012.
        Like a good chunk of the young 'uns voting for the first time this year remember as part of childhood a friend losing a home to the bank.
        We don't talk foreclosure it's taught as a shameful experience best kept quiet. But it's a massive part of the modern American experience.

        Talked recently to the founder of a startup in transportation. Came away convinced the big car cos are even more screwed than I thought.
        It will be interesting if the big car cos are replaced by (in the sense of their revenues going to) new cos with tech co margins.

        The tricky thing about thinking about public policy re: Uber employees is that conventional taxi drivers are also all exploited.
        It's neat and all but "largest ever DDoS attack" is literally one of the 3 oldest stories in Internet security.
        SUPER FUN TRUE FUN FACT: modern IDS/IPS systems all began as an attempt at anti-DDoS, which was RealSecure's first purpose.
        It's like 80% hangover but I knew as soon as I typed the string "RealSecure" I'd have to talk to fucking Rob Graham about BlackICE.
        @tqbf Fyodor modifying @nmap to mock BlackICE at @cansecwest remains a highlight in conference talks for me. ^_^

        You make a simple comment about how banal "biggest DDoS ever" stories are and all the sudden you've got the BlackICE release schedule open.
        This is how he gets you. You're only ever 2-3 degrees of Kevin Bacon away from BlackICE. It's infuriating.
        I'm so sad to see the return of "Opportunistic Encryption" for HTTPS. It's disingenuous and harmful to a secure web. Use U-I-R. Use HSTS.
