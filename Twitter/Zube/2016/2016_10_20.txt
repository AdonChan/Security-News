        1/ Stand back! I don't know how big my rant will be about this: https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/silicon-valley-confronts-its-peter-thiel-problem?utm_term=.dcalV9N3oM ...  via @nitashatiku @buzzfeednews
        /2 Silicon Valley doesn't have a Peter Theil problem. SV is full of Peter Theils who have had their dark neoliberal hearts hidden by HR.
        3/ Tech is full of libertarians. Some with a capital "L", and some with a lower case (like me. I am a libertarian.  Gabba gabba we accept)
        4/ But Peter Theil's "eccentric" pro-Trump neofascist leanings are not very far outside of the center of VC gravity politically.
        5/ Theil is in the $b club. People in that club in tech generally fall into two categories:  the Foundation founders and the cutthroats.
        6/ Nearly every exec I ever met in SV was inherently conservative. Even the Foundation founders. They believe in the Triumph of the Will.
        7/ Not in the Nazi sense, necessarily, but that they created their fortunes purely by the force of their own will- through their superpowers
        8/ Some want to use their powers for good. They join the Clinton Global Initiative and shit. They try to shape the world in their image.
        9/ Theil is just like them. He wants to use his $ to shape the world in his image. His image, however, is not shiny and happy.
        10/ In a way Theil is actually more honest about his motives. He wants a world that respects his kind: really rich people.
        11/ ISV billionaires may actually legitimately want to make the world a better place. But they want to do it on their terms. Shut up gov't!
        12/ most SV billionaires, however, have people they hired to preserve their image and brand. Theil does not care.
        13/ rant complete for now.
        /14 except to add: everyone in SV / tech is on the spectrum, if you know what I mean. Me included. It presents worse with entitlement.

        For the 3 of you who follow me who are policy nerds who haven't already heard the http://Vox.com  weeds podcast... 
        ...  the episode about the Trump debate -- forget the Trump debate coverage, who cares, but... 
        ...  and look I feel like The Weeds podcast rarely delivers for me and I don't keep up with it but I listened to this one episode... 
        ...  the last segment of the Trump debate Weeds podcast where they're trying to sense of Trump's policy language... 
        If you are a policy nerd, you NEED to hear Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff trying to make sense of Trump's health plan.

        Compare the information design of the FiveThirtyEight prediction histogram to that of Sam Wang's meta-analysis (http://election.princeton.edu/history-of-meta-analysis/ ... )
        Notice how the 538 design magnifies volatility by pointlessly dedicating half its pixels to non-data (Trump's odds).
        This election is exciting! It looks like the spectrogram of an EDM track! Keep checking back for more! Maybe debate #3 will change game!
        Wang's line: "This election is a stable plot around a ~3.5-4.5 margin for one candidate. Get back to work answering your emails."
        This seems like a great job
        Rust now uses Blake2b for incremental compilation fingerprints!
