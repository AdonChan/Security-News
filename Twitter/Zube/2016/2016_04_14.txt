        Just submitted me and @nudehaberdasher's talk for @BlackHatUSA.  Waited until the last second this year because still finding new fun stuffs
        Today after a contentious meeting at work, I had to be carried out of the room by @nudehaberdasher
        The wifi going out in my telepresence robot was a factor
        I'll be giving a talk tonight at @IllinoisStateU.  If you're in the area, come by to check it out and say hi.
        Finally accomplished what I've been trying against the car for the last few months.  A day late for blackhat but I'll update the submission.
        I'm afraid to report vulns now because I don't want to get made fun of like the bad lock folks.

        40 USC Â§Â§5104(e)(1)(A) & 5109 make it a federal crime to possess a dagger, dirk, or stiletto at the US Capitol. Any arrests for that today?
        21 USC Â§333 & 21 CFR Â§133.169(a)(1) make it a federal crime to sell pasteurized process cheese not mixed into a "homogenous plastic mass."

        Progressive Hillary fans are brave. Standing with coups, invasions, mass murder, corporate plunder, assaults on the poor. That takes guts.
        What's even braver is their resignation that nothing can be seriously changed. They prefer pragmatic nightmares to "socialist dreams."

        There are people in government who would say that your "emotions are unproductive" as we locked up the Japanese in internment camps.
        A "mysterious low profile hacker whose identity shall remain anonymous" sounds a lot like "we're going to lose our case with Apple".
        Notes that other "anonymous sources" have been cited in #AppleVsFBI that later disappeared from news articles with no trace. Not reliable.
        Thing I don't like about Comey, based on his statements, he's a relativist: truth, the constitution, even human rights are relative to him.
        OH: Well, the way the Internet has turned out, researchers should have originally called it the DERPANET.
        Drinking coffee. Getting nicer by the minute.
        WaPo is starting a media firestorm with this anonymous source they've cited for #AppleVsFBI. Hope they're not wrong for their sake.
        WaPo didn't even cite the background of their anonymous source. We're they FBI? We're they Cellebrite? Homeless Joe on 2nd? Ludicrous.
        @JZdziarski Homeless Joe always has the good tips.
        FBI hiring hackers is inconsistent with Comey's past statements of purchasing from a professional company with a rep of protecting IP.
        If there is any truth to the FBI buying a solution from hackers then we should be asking why it's being kept off the books.
        Either WaPo is caught up in a series of lies, or FBI is. It's unclear which one it is though.https://twitter.com/JZdziarski/status/720230162860797952 ... 
        @JZdziarski @reneritchie i mean, I'm. If going to speculate publicly. But Ellen is one of the best national security reporters out there
        @JZdziarski I think it's possible Cellebrite brought the exploit to them. Both would be telling truth, but fudging all embarrassing bits

        there are currently 3.8 MILLION rdp endpoints on shodan.
        A "mysterious low profile hacker whose identity shall remain anonymous" sounds a lot like "we're going to lose our case with Apple".
        Notes that other "anonymous sources" have been cited in #AppleVsFBI that later disappeared from news articles with no trace. Not reliable.
        @SwiftOnSecurity @nakashimae I always questioned why people assumed Cellebrite. The FBI PO cited was for 7 1-year license renewals in Ill.
        @SwiftOnSecurity @nakashimae It was also odd that *every* article saying Cellebrite cited the same newspaper in Israel as the source.
        @MalwareTechBlog @SwiftOnSecurity @nakashimae That's the gist of it, yes. Some articles claimed that newspaper was known for embellishing

        Will some regulators always require storage of files within a certain country or will they embrace encryption and redundancy eventually
        @WeldPond country based storage of data is more nationalism then logical tech use. Gov's will always mandate it's storage with their borders

        Most recent public breaks of NSA's Simon+Speck have jumped to ~70% rounds for all variants. NSA tries to pretend it knew this would happen.
        A minute later the same NSA designer advocates 48-bit block size and claims incorrectly that CTR mode makes this safe for gigabytes of data.
        NSA claims that having 70% of Simon+Speck broken is ok. Why? "AES." Um, how about ARX? "ChaCha." But ChaCha has much bigger security margin.
        We have established a liaison with WG2 of ISO SC27. ISO has a study period on post-quantum crypto (we submitted our https://pqcrypto.eu.org/docs/initial-recommendations.pdf ... )

        Goldwasser and Kalai claimed X1. I gave easy counterexample to X1. Apparently they then switched to X2. But X2 is just as easy to disprove!

        Hey @mattblaze, I found a new excellent metaphor for computer security:http://i.imgur.com/swDLceH.gifv 
        Unpatched iPhones can be bricked (and maybe fried) by setting the date to 1/1/70 (the Unix beginning of time). http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/04/new-threat-can-auto-brick-apple-devices/ ... 
        I'm amazed no one found this before, given that if a network timestamp is going to be wrong, 1/1/70 is frequently what it will be.
        I actually had a doormat stolen once. If there had been a key under it, I probably would have been burglarized, too.
        "Can you please completely explain [complex thing you've worked on and written about extensively] in 140 characters?"
        .@SpireSec You seem to be trying to cross examine me, or trying to get me to state a conclusion based on incomplete information. Sorry.
        Don't wait until there's a logo and cutesy attack name to patch your iPhone/iPad.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/719914073043951616 ... 
        @mattblaze Epocholypse. I call dibs on it
        Nothing to remind me of how infuriated closed-access academic publishing makes me like when I run up against it in my own work.

        A brief power cut. Perhaps the gods are angry. Perhaps a local scrote has fried himself while pinching copper from the substation.
        Just had a "how has it come to this?" moment about the EU referendum. It's like we want official recognition of our tin-pot shithole status.
        Nigel Farage with a saucepan on his head, banging it with a wooden spoon and shouting "bloody foreigners" while marching down The Mall.
        Boris Johnson dressed in a safari suit and pith helmet, reliving the glory days of the Empire, smacking passers-by with a riding crop.
        Some nonsense about "putting the 'great' back in Great Britain". It'd be easier to change the name of the country. Feckless Arsehole Land.
        Really Fucking Depressingly Average Britain. The Small Minded Drab Kingdom. The Country That Smells A Bit Like Damp Soil. Doggingland.
        Let's shrink away from the world, brick up the Channel Tunnel and burn ourselves to death in the white heat of our collective ignorance.
        That concludes my application for a job at Visit Britain.
        'Lorraine' is on ITV1. She's just finished sucking off a horse. Guest Nigel Havers is applauding.
        Memo all departments: please stop referring to things that aren't bad and aren't boys as "bad boys".

        #PMQs A sweaty, paranoid George Osborne has just pulled a knife on Jeremy Corbyn. Osborne is agitated and shouting something about moths.
        #PMQs Osborne is shouting about tax moths and is blaming Corbyn for releasing them into the chamber. He's waving that knife like a madman.
        #PMQs Cameron is awkwardly trying to bring Osborne back down to Earth but Osborne is wild-eyed. Corbyn is eyeing the flailing knife.
        #PMQs It's over. Diane Abbott has delivered a brutal roundhouse kick to Osborne's head and the Chancellor has gone down like a sack of crap.

        So who else is just hanging around Twitter waiting for #badlock news?
        This must be what buying tickets to ShmooCon feels like. 
        #badlock is DDOS and mitm... At first glance, doesn't match the hype
        It's an official cry wolf then.https://twitter.com/bugch3ck/status/719925028528242688 ... 

        I will be kind and say that I am underwhelmed thus far.  mITM and DOS.  Few deets.... #badlock
        Man-in-The-Middle? Are you kidding me.... that is all we get out of #BadLock ? No remote code exec?
        .@johullrich  which, coincidentally you could already do with smb relaying...
        *record scratch* wait. so.
        Functionality that has existed for years has a much larger impact. Pth, mimikatz, SMB relays, etc etc
        In other news, we have figured out the pwnie award winner for 2016 for "most overhyped bug" and possibly "lamest vendor response" #badlock
        I hope badlock is the end of this named vuln bullshit. All hype, no glory.
        so #badlock seems to be ms16-047. claims privesc / access to SAM, so there might be something worth digging into, but still meh

        Wait, is #badlock is just NTLMSSP MiTM? Because that's been public for at least a decade. I've presented it several times along w/ KARMA.
