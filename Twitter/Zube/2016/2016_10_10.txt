        Kaspersky Internet Security is the first A/V for Mac I've tested that's actually catching things like Mokes and Sofacy (Komplex). Good job.
        The Nightly Build of #LittleFlocker automatically whitelists Kaspersky on install, or you can add the contrib rule if you install it later.
        . @cibercrimen I reached out to ESET and they don't seem to care about false positives or breaking other sw. So Kaspersky might be better.
        At this rate, @realDonaldTrump might make it into the sex offender registry before he's sworn into office.

        What do men want? They want a lot of pals, and they wish that people wouldn't get so mad at them.
        Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh,  there is less cleaning up to do afterward.

        Every single @realDonaldTrump hotel and golf course is toast. Done. Over. Bernie Madoff now has a better brand.
        Let's be clear. It shouldn't have taken a Presidential run for Trump's history of sexual assault to become a problem for him.
        America is incredibly lucky, Trump could easily have won if he were just slightly less stupid, lazy and vile
        President Obama mentions "monopoly and rent-seeking" as an economic problem.http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21708216-americas-president-writes-us-about-four-crucial-areas-unfinished-business-economic ... 
        Here's my hot take. This race has been, with all its insanity, a far more substantive election policy-wise than commonly understood.
        In both primaries, trade, race, inequality, and questions of gender bias were front and center. So was the structure and ethics of media.
        We've debated the nature of authoritarianism, celebrity politics, big business, and deep regional and cultural divides.
        It is scary to have a debate about who we really are because we must face some very ugly truths. So it's tempting to downplay the substance.
        A  gigantic generation, millennials, formed by their childhood in a financial/foreclosure crisis, is coming of age.
        And big business is finally being debated. The background hum of Wells Fargo, Mylan, pharmabro, etc.
        Elizabeth Warren gave the most important anti-monopoly speeches of the still-young century.http://washingtonmonthly.com/2016/06/30/elizabeth-warrens-consolidation-speech-could-change-the-election/ ... 
        The head of antitrust for DOJ followed Warren with a rejection of the 40 year old pro-big business consensus. https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-renata-hesse-antitrust-division-delivers-opening ... 
        We're even debating new foreign/cyber questions. Russian hacking of elections, Chinese money in a Bush superpac.https://theintercept.com/2016/08/03/gop-lawyer-chinese-owned-company-us-presidential-politics/ ... 
        And the sexual politics are new. Never again will we expect and demand that politicians have perfect nuclear families.
        Pricing laws, NAFTA, China PNTR, fascism, Russia, antitrust, health care mergers, cyberwar, the nature of corruption... very broad scope.
        Anyway, I suspect this election will reverberate in important and interesting ways for the rest of our lives.
