        The most unrealistic part about Batman vs. Superman was the assumption that both of them could exercise perfectly good OPSEC all their life.
        She had a special name for one of those nights when she was left disappointed because it turned out smaller than she'd hoped.
        Theory: NSA/CIA employees aren't exercising bad OPSEC on LinkedIn. They're leaking details they need us to know about, w/some deniability.
        Very helpful for future cases to watch FBI unable to keep one single exploit in their pants for more than a week.

        Maturity is a bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy anything.
        There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too.
        If what Jesus said was good, what can it matter whether he was God or not?

        Interesting question about aliasing: does writing to an allocated memory via a member of a struct set effective type for the whole struct?
        Writing to a member of a struct can overwrite padding, right? Even non-adjacent padding (C11, 6.2.6.1p6). I think this answers the question.

        Legal question. Say a Chilean unscrews the glass globe off the South Pole marker, and impales a Norwegian on it. Who tries the case?
        There's a fun domestic version of this puzzle (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=691642 ... ) but the South Pole one has at least 8 competing jurisdictions
        This is probably why they keep that round globe on top of the pole marker

        Is there any trick to lift the 3rd world Internet restrictions on iPhones? Like download content > 100mb via LTE instead of wifi ? (No jb)
        So is the restriction that you cannot download e.g. audiobooks > 100mb via LTE a carrier profile restriction, or hardcoded in OS?
        Paraphrased: why do I pay for an LTE "flat" for my iPhone if I cannot use it? (Even 35 mb OTA cannot be done without wifi)
        LOL someone suggested to reboot my iPhone after the "refuse to download more than 100mb via LTE" message and after reboot it auto downloads
        So when your iPhone refuses to download X because it is too big for cellular,try rebooting.Might auto download/work afterwards. #dailyioswtf
        . @msolnik if it is an iPhone carrier restriction then @Telekom_hilft is to blame for not reconfiguring it for LTE customers?!?
