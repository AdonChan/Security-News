        I remember Phyllis Schlafly on NIGHTLINE complaining about how the Liberal Media labeled Reagan's SDI as Star Wars.
        She preferred "High Frontier," which sounds like a bad 60's TV series with Barbara Stanwyck and Lorne Greene.
        But unlike certain feminists who helped cover for Bill Clinton, Schlafly stuck to her awful, ideological views.pic.twitter.com/13qox0tPhQ

        How to get the raw NTLM for PTH/OPTH out of a NTLM C/R with the new DES KPA mode in hashcat: https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-5832.html ... 
        hashcat now supports raw DES cracking (KPA), doing 20Gk/s per GTX1080. IOW: Cracks every DES key in 80 hours average on a $5000 PC.
        I don't think people fully understand how bad this is for defenders.  https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-5832.html ...  1/?
        Atom says full ntlm key recovery from ntlmv1 / mschapv2 in ~80 hours for 5k worth of hardware  2/?
        Given how often mschaov2 is used in Corp wifi, this means guaranteed ntlm hash in just over 4 days of course time.  3/?
        Guaranteed ntlm creds in most places in 4 days for 5k.  That is a low entry price point with little defense aside from nuking mschapv2 4/?
        The cost in both dollars and time will only go down moving forward.  5/5

        Having multiple children is a daily, delightful refutation of the blank slate hypothesis. They are so different.
        Hardcore blank-slaters must either never spend time around children, or view them through rigidly ideological eyes.
        Recently I asked a mother of (fraternal) twins what they had in common. She thought for a long time, then said "nothing."

        (we're playing around with some ideas, not entirely about hiring, which I am still working on)
        Reminder that the real statistic is murders PER CAPITA, not murders overall.
        Per capita, does Chicago even make the top 10?
        (four suburbs of Chicago appear to: East Chicago, Chicago Heights, Harvey, and Gary Indiana)
        d'oh. That's top 30. Only Gary is in the top 10.
