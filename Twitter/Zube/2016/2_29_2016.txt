        Theory: Apple broke everyone's computer with the last software update to demonstrate how nobody should trust the software update process.

        Gonna tweet a few quotes from James Madison. We'd better hope he didn't know what the hell he was talking about, right? Okay, here you go:
        1. "If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy."
        2. "It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad."
        3. "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."
        4. "Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other."
        5. "The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home."
        So unless Madison didn't have a clue, we need to choose between our love of war and our devotion to democracy. Right now looks a bit bleak.

        Welcome to the new phase of the election, where any journalistic scrutiny of Clinton will be berated as an effort to help Trump.

        In midlife, after decades in a change-resistant society, many come to believe serious dissent & resistance to institutional power is futile

        Interesting about 2016 election: investigative journalism has had almost no impact. None of the big stories have really affected the race.
        This creates a bad cycle: good journos become less interested in doing this hard work, knowing its lack of impact https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/703973661850497024 ... 
        Clinton's base is Wall St donors + black voters & seniors, the latter 2 groups which have been hurt by Wall St.
        Considering the Clinton royal dynasty & reality TV mogul Trump, the other grand unifying theory of the primaries might be:

        Of note: when using this rather than the official app, at no point do you have to authenticate to the bridge
        If you provide a MAC, it must be one that's been associated with the device or you get rejected. If you don't, it just listens to you.
        Plus, the only thing that's actually gated on that is the discovery packets. Once you know the IP, you can control it.
        And the rejection packet is a unicast IP packet. So even when it rejects you, it gives you everything you need to control the lights.
