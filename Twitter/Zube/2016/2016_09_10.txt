        Do folks realize that everything Colin Powell wrote in email to HRC abt how he circumvented State Dept email he disclosed in his book? P 109

        14. I suspect Wells Fargo execs are like that too. They spend their time managing compliance of a giant bureaucracy rather than a business.
        15. They know it's not underlying productive economic activity for normal people. They know that. But they think there is no alternative.
        16. I mean if you break up the banks into smaller pieces then does that mean that just anyone can get loans and access to capital markets?
        17. And this is the ultimate point of restructuring the banking system. Right now no one is in charge. Elites have veto power but that's it.
        18. So we drift. And issue fines. And productivity drops. And problems pie up. And bitterness, stagnation and private jets.
        19. But this is fundamentally an *intellectual* problem. And it is fixable! The answer to Buffett is either act like an owner or hands off.
        20. Right-size institutions so they are the size that a person can manage. Smaller means more efficient.
        21. There is a long political tradition in America of doing this. It is in fact our central commercial/political tradition.
        22. It is why we rebelled against England. Absentee ownership. It is why we rebelled against Hamilton's Federalists.
        23. It's not the theft. It's the *indifference*. It's the lack of community self-governance and individual freedom. We know what to do.
        24. FDR broke the bankers in the 1930s and decentralized power to small businessmen, farmers, and workers.
        25. It's how we built Silicon Valley, how we defeated the Nazis, and how we stopped a thousand years of war in Europe. We can do it again.

        I wonder when security best practices start advise that we take off our (accelerator- & mic-equipped) watches before typing in passwords?
        A prudent user, BTW, needs not much more than two passwords per physical device: 1) disk encryption passphrase, and 2) screenlocker pass.
        Rest we let password managers to handle (not necessarily could-backed managers though;).
        It might be useful if @QubesOS account could get a @verified status. Anybody can help to arrange that?

        Home-made french fries are for chumps.
        Wash, dice 2-3 russets. Rinse them again in a bowl, then microwave (in that bowl probably) for 12-13 minutes.
        Heat 1.5 cups of whatever oil in a cast iron skillet. Shallow fry potatoes. Retrieve, drain, salt.
        (you can let the oil cool and strain it into a deli cup and re-use it several times)
        Microwaved then shallow-fried diced potatoes meet all criteria for superior fries except for shape. Who cares about shape.
        I have done the Full Arnold Cooking Issues fry, I've done the Kenji fry-and-freeze. Microwave and shallow-fry is 94-98% as good, 5% effort.

        Governor Pence, Vladimir Putin is a strong leader in the same way arsenic is a strong drink. Your country should be ashamed of you.
