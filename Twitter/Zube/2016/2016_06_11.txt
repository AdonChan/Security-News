        Note the solid Z80 origins (via the 8080 and then 8086), the rings and the sanctimonious software at the top fixing everything with religion
        So, let's imagine that the software in your medical device is counterfeit because there's a cheaper "firmware update"
        ...  and that that this "cheaper alternative" has been tested even more laughably than what passes for testing for the original... 
        ...  how does one detect original medical hardware running counterfeit software?
        ...  or,  indeed, how does one detect counterfeit hardware running original software?
        This goes beyond "security" as it is now an issue between coupling the device, to its firmware, to the testing which should go with it.
        Note: "the hardware won't accept counterfeit software" or "counterfeit hardware will not run original software" -> already been proven wrong

        Because there's nothing like 80 pages of tech policy law to start your day.
        Bottom line on our paper: Find the 3rd party doctrine confusing? Having a trouble distinguishing content from metadata? Then you understand.
        This is now the second time I've seen someone use their global service status to try to remove someone else's bag from the overhead bin. WTF
        It didn't work this time, either. But geez, some people.
        @mattblaze Our overhead lockers are full so we'll have to ask you to check your privilege.
        @mattblaze Oxygen will continue to flow even if your sense of entitlement does not fully inflate.
        Entitled Global Services Man just spilled coffee on his lap. I feel bad for not feeling at all bad.

        ...huh! Tweetdeck has partial support for twitter polls now.
        Ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact.
        And while that user's assessment is a -little- harsh, it does bear out IME - most folk don't really want to know how computers work.
        That they -do- work and that they can do their work is the relevant part. Technical details are irrelevant to them.
