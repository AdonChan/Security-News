        A new kind of ad on YouTube that's, interestingly, not on the YT ad format page: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en ...   "What is this, YT?"  YT: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯pic.twitter.com/coC72xUO39
        That's now 4 ads to see per YouTube video: Pre-roll, Display, Sidebar Video, & Product.  Never mind embedded ads, and post rolls. Bit much?

        Also, this box makes me wonder, does the creator get a cut?  I mean, I _assume_ so, but I've never seen these in my analytics.pic.twitter.com/2I54BqZOFu
