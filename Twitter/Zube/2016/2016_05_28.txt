        "This lawsuit is part of a billionaire plan to avenge an unrelated slight" seems like an argument the jury should have heard.
        Ok, I'm going to point out something that @iwelsh first noted. Money is just permission to use resources.
        That means that a billionaire isn't wealthy because he has a bunch of gold coins in a Scrooge McDuck style swimming pool.
        It means he is wealthy because he has captured a strategic point in the economy somewhere.
        The more chokepoints, the more billionaires. They are just the capitalization of encumbrances to the free flow of commerce.
        Concentrating all this permission to use resources - money - in the hands of those skilled at monetizing bottlenecks is a political choice.
        The second richest man in the world - Carlos Slim - lost $22B b/c antitrust busted up his telecom monopoly.http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/12/09/mexicos-carlos-slim-is-the-years-biggest-billionaire-loser/#1121e72539dd ... 
        It's not that his swimming pool of gold coins was drained, it's that a democratic gov't damaged his ability to monetize a choke point.
        It's not that Peter Thiel is trying to influence media, it's that his influence is overwhelming b/c of this concentration of power.
        To make a literary analogy, the problem isn't Peter Thiel, it's that no one can use the One Ring without doing damage.
