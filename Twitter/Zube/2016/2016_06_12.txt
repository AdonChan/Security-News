        . @jvanegue @Microsoft New mitigation CPU feature? 5+ years Bypassing it? < 3 months
        One more thing about Intel's CET. It's based on a an existing mitigation technology (Microsoft's CFG) that I bypassed without code changes.
        I thought I hadn't enabled it, but it turned out to be so coarse grained that the exploit just still worked. Meh.
        Let's be honest with ourselves. Intel sees CET as a driver to get people to buy new processors again... Didn't work with NX. Shipped off!
        As a security practitioner, I would not buy a new CPU just to get a security feature. But I believe in bug squashing so what do I know...

        Increasingly common delusion is a belief that you are the target of large-scale, organized surveillance.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/gang-stalking-targeted-individuals.html ... 
        I get contacted by people who appear to be suffering from this from time to time; I wish there was a good way to guide them to help.
        Obviously surveillance capabilities & deployment have increased. But sad that public awareness of this risks becoming pathological.
        Our community's glib pronouncements about real surveillance policy issues don't help; not sure what we can/should do to mitigate this.
