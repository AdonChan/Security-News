        21 USC §676 & 9 CFR §317.8(b)(4) make it a federal crime to sell "spring lamb" not killed between March and the first full week of October.
        21 USC §676 & 9 CFR §316.11(d) make it a federal crime to sell smoke-flavored meat, without saying it's been smoke-flavored on the label.

i0n1c

        Well @Razzilient @Morpheus______ we are not in violation of Apple rules. We called function defined in SDK and allowed by sandbox.
        . @chmod007 @Morpheus______ everybody outside of Apple is already WTFing that seeing your own process list is a privacy violation
        @i0n1c @chmod007 @Morpheus______ It's more the opposite of a privacy violation, as it allows one to verify that nothing unwanted is running.
        . @sdotknight no idea. I did not talk to the Apple guy my colleague did.
        . @sdotknight the issue is we made them look stupid they backlash
        Fun fact: during the lifetime of every single iOS process csops() is called at least once by dynamic linker.
        LOL I was just notified that our app was pulled because we use the icon of another app and would be fraud. Priceless !
        This is just priceless:pic.twitter.com/0kvdSUWfLG
        My AppStore talk gets better by the minute
        So Apple continues to fail by rejecting our App as fraud and due to icon theft. Good job Apple review guy. You work at the right company.
        And of course the actual fraudulent app is still available in the store
        Okay I have read the rejection. So we only need to use another icon and then can resubmit . Perfect.
        Come on guys - the conference lightning talk I got out of this all will be epic.
        At least the actual fraudulent app is gone now too from the store.
        Anyway I can only warn people do use functions you find in iOS SDK public header files. Even if the header says they are allowed in iOS.
        Kinda hilarious some Apple lemmings believe that pulling our harmless app will stop other malware/adware from detecting apps on phone
        @i0n1c section 2.19 is their go-to clause for rejecting anything they don't like, seen that many times before. There is no way around it.
        Here. It basically says: we do not want our users to have the impression iOS could have security holes. go away.pic.twitter.com/7II1q96ZMt
        . @iKernul that app does not succeed to show the processlist because it calls a different API.
        The irony is that there are hundreds of apps with diagnostics information but Apple killed only us. Go figure.
        Scrolling back through Stevan Esser's/@i0n1c's timeline, apparently his rootkit-detection app got pulled by Apple?http://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/05/09/new-iphone-app-lets-you-know-if-youre-being-spied-on/ ... 
        Apple pull security app saying its inaccurate because there is no accurate way to check if Apple is secure @i0n1chttps://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/731545154872614913 ... 
        Hey @reconmtl please reserve a lightning talk slot for me. I have an Apple story :-)
        The funny thing is:even the fact our app showing Apple accessibility bundles as anomaly that they did not let us fix was technically correct
        Also I internally predicted that If Apple pulls the app they will wait out the media hype when people lose interest - exactly what happened
        Fun fact: our app went 3 times though Apple review because of some bugfixes. Only in the 4 review it is suddenly considered unwanted.
        I hope media takes away the important fact: there is no chance at all the AppStore review process will stop anyone from smuggling stuff in.
        Guys I have literally 40 degree fever right now ... Once I recover I will start writing the blog posts about how the iOS 9 processlist works
        When you search for "system and security info" you only find the game letter fall. Why? Fraudulent use of the name of our former app? 22.2?
        After that title I don't even want to watch this.https://twitter.com/prankreviewer/status/731716246132142080 ... 
        Is there any way Google project zero would be willing to sponsor/support the necessary research/QA to recheck all "fixed" Apple CVEs?
        In the last 2 years I uncovered numerous Apple CVEs that were fixed incorrectly (sometime 4 updates required to finally fix) which shows ...
        ... Total lack of any QA on security and privacy features at Apple. The process list in iOS 9 only worked because NO ONE at Apple ever ...
        ... Tested with 3 lines of code if the privacy problems were ever fixed.
        And as a thank you for pointing this out out app is thrown out of the AppStore. 
        . @astarasikov there is no point in contacting Apple as long their in the "we have no problem" denial phase.
        . @astarasikov I want that people stop reporting new bugs to Apple and first publicly expose how many of the old bugs were never fixed
        . @astarasikov MSFT publicly announced that they will change but Apple publicly claims they are the best already
        But why do I actually complain about Apple "fixing" memory corruptions in 2010 that can still jailbreak iOS 9.3.2 
        . @sharedRoutine we thought it would not pass initial review but after it passed 3 times through review we thought it would be fine
        . @sharedRoutine there is nothing to piss people off: it was a system info tool showing a process list and jailbreak status/like other apps
        . @sharedRoutine fact is there were many apps showing a process list before iOS 9, but they all broke. We only released a working one.
        . @sharedRoutine there are people who told us we should have taken more than 99 cent because it was worth it.
        Btw I am not releasing a jailbreak as payback. That would be dumb.
        Dumb people are not smart.

        In what universe do hidden microphones without at least one party not require a warrant under Title III?https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/731622187208167424 ... 
        This is so egregious, either the article has facts wrong or feds are trying to expand what's permitted under T3 to point of meaninglessness.
        Facts here seem to be remarkably similar to those in Katz (the case that established the warrant requirement in the first place).

        Here are three great books on Revolutionary era fights over the politics of money, class, and military matters.
        Founding Finance: How Debt, Speculation, Foreclosures, Protests, and Crackdowns Made Us a Nationhttp://www.amazon.com/Founding-Finance-Speculation-Foreclosures-Discovering/dp/0292757530 ... 
        Taming Democracy: "The People," the Founders, and the Troubled Ending of the American Revolutionhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/taming-democracy-9780195378566?cc=us&lang=en& ... 
        Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783-1802http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-Sword-Federalists-Establishment-1783-1802/dp/0029175518 ... 
        Founding Finance and Taming Democracy were excellent, Eagle and Sword was useful but less coherent.
        Richard Kohn basically laid out the case that Alexander Hamilton's ultimate goal was to become a military dictator of the U.S.
        And that Hamilton nearly became so in 1798-1799, but was opposed by President Adams and the emerging Republican opposition.
        Kohn wrote his book during Watergate. He analogized the founding era post-Constitution as similar to the McCarthy era in terms of danger.
        Republican opponents of the Federalists in the late 1790s were derided as Jacobins manipulated or in league with the French revolutionaries.
        Bouton's book on the regulator wars is excellent. He shows that Hamiltonians forced defaults on war debts when debt was owned by farmers.
        And that Hamiltonian policies essentially led to a Great Depression like catastrophe in the 1780s and 1790s.
        @matthewstoller A bit ago I read a selection of 1800 Federalist propaganda from NE warning Jefferson & Reps would take away their bibles
        Founding Finance by @WilliamHogeland was written in the context of Occupy Wall Street. Very much worth reading.http://www.amazon.com/Founding-Finance-Speculation-Foreclosures-Discovering/dp/0292757530 ... 
        Hamilton is this weird mix of J. Edgar Hoover, Joe McCarthy, Alan Greenspan, and Robert Rubin.
        Hamilton, for instance, allowed merchants to cheat on their taxes while provoking farmers into rebellion so he could crush them.
        He argued that Western farmers who opposed his economic policies were part of a French plot to overthrow the American government.
        Meanwhile, he wrote, "good will of the Merchants is very important," and "It is a rule, in a doubtful case, to lean in favor of Merchants."
        Hamilton hired as whiskey tax assessors whiskey merchants, creating whiskey monopolists who used the tax to crush small competitors.
        I forgot to mention Rupert Murdoch. Ownership of the press was critical to Hamiltonian financial politics.

        It's remarkably tricky to track podcast/mp3 downloads accurately via the web. Partial/"streamed" downloads, failed & retried downloads, ...
        "grep -c mp3 access.log" doesn't quite cut it.
        $ zgrep 'mp3' access.log* | grep 'GET /wp-content/' | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/access.log.[[:digit:]].gz://g' | sort | uniq  | wc -l
        Shit like this makes me consider 10$/month plans for "podcast hosting" that offer nicely presented stats. Sigh.

        The trouble with having an opinion is that someone might agree with it.
        Let's compare everything to Hitler.
        "You know," Boris Johnson remarks. "Hitler is very much like making love to a beautiful woman. You end up shooting yourself in her bunker."
