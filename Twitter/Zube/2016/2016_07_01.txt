        hmm, doesn't look like headless chrome is very good cpu perf wise :/. 15 seconds longer to load http://independent.co.uk  much higher CPU.
        guess i'll stick with chromium and xvfb

        Gove running for Tory leader. The cunts have taken over the cunt asylum, which was already run by cunts but apparently not cuntily enough.
        Gove, May, Johnson, Crabb, Hunt. The dream team, if you dream a lot about arseholes.
        I can only hope Johnson didn't see Gove's betrayal coming and is absolutely, unstoppably, apoplectically furious.
        We're going to need a new word that's worse than cunt.
        Johnson quitting the leadership race after casually fucking the country to death could destroy him personally. So there's still hope.
        We are so unrelentingly and cataclysmically hosed.
        I'd settle for a third party coup right about now.
        If nothing else, we can say we were alive at the dawn of the New Stupidity.
        This is a victory for the little man only in the sense that Michael Gove is a little man.
        The best thing about post-referendum Britain is all the control we've got back. We're completely in control. Never been more in control.
        If things carry on like this by next week our new prime minister will be David Cameron.
        The prime minister's resigned. There is no functional opposition. Scotland wants independence. The referendum was a bullshit fandango. (1/3)
        There must be a plan for when things get this fucked this fast. A contingency to stabilise the country and turn this nonsense off. (2/3)
        But it seems our best hope is the Queen strapping on a bandolier, pumping a shotgun one-handed and saying "This. Ends. Now." (3/3)
        Regardless of what you think about Jeremy Corbyn, it's clear that he isn't thinking about the country this week.
        I suppose what makes this even more galling for Boris is that he was outmanoeuvred by a man he called "The Gover".
        YES THE CURRENT SITUATION IS QUITE LIKE A TV SHOW WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF POLITICAL MACHINATIONS WELL SPOTTED HAVE A FUCKING BISCUIT.
        If the military decides to step in I hope they'll do it next week after I've flown out of the country.
