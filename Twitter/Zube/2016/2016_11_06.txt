        I suspect that the 2016 election will be the drunken character actor that we love for a time and then forget. Either that, or WW3.

        In a Sri Lankan airport lounge watching an anticolonialist struggle play out in the breakfast buffet. Eggs benedict vs. mystery rice rhombus
        Rice rhombus has been identified as kiribath, rice cooked with coconut milk. I want to marry it, live together forever and meet its family
        It's hanging out with its friends lunu miris and katta sambol. Verdict: in a Sri Lankan airport breakfast situation, eschew eggs benedict
        Ripping up my onward ticket so that I can live the rest of my days in this airport lounge
        @Pinboard This advice need not be limited to airports of the Sri Lankan persuasion.
