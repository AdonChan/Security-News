        .@osxreverser yes! I profoundly agree with what it says in the Italian Constitution: voting is your right and your duty.
        .@thegrugq NATO members are not meant invoke Article 5 amongst themselves, unless we want to try a "NATO Brexit" too... 
        You all know what this translates to... 
        Either GCHQ's breach of Belgacom was a cyber attack, or it wasn't. If it wasn't, then it is OK for Russia to do too w/o triggering article-5
        .@thegrugq you are mixing your toasties: act of war & espionage. Article 5 is invoked following an "act of war". There's a definition for it
        .@thegrugq just because it is appealing to kick up storm linked to Brexit you cannot conflate espionage with war. GCHQ in Belgacom? Not war.

        Because you're the fucking prime minister you spam-faced douchebugle.pic.twitter.com/Uwgmug0HVM
        George Osborne wakes up in a skip, a traffic cone on his head and a new tattoo of Cher on his arse. "Now THAT was a referendum," he smirks.
        I've slept on it and I think I've got all the anger out of my sy WHAT THE FUCKING HELL DID YOU DO YOU FUCKING VOTE LEAVE ARSEHOLES?
        The petition for a second referendum smacks of something Farage would have campaigned for had things not gone his way.
        Having said that, this graphic speaks volumes about why acting on the result of the referendum would be a bad idea.pic.twitter.com/23fjzxIe8l
        So surely the thing to do would be to accept the result but campaign to try and ensure that article 50 is never invoked.
        It's almost as if all that money we pay to the EU benefits us in some way in return. Who would have thought it.
        Moody's cuts UK's credit rating from 'stable' to 'holy fucking shit'.
        So we're about 30 hours in to taking our country back and we're already Â£1.2bn in the hole for Yorkshire and Cornwall's lost EU funding.
        But, you know, sovereignty is priceless, isn't it.
        Just got hit by another wave of YOU STUPID TORY CUNTS HOW COULD YOU HAVE BEEN SO FUCKING RECKLESS WITH 65 MILLION LIVES?
        UK European Commission resigns saying "what is done cannot be undone". We're taking being fucked to an all new level.
        Sign my online petition to have "what is done cannot be undone" adopted as the motto of the United Kingdom.
        Apart from Nicola Sturgeon, have any of our political leaders said anything reassuring yet?
        No prime minister, no chancellor, no UK EU commissioner, no opposition, just Johnson, Gove and Farage riding us over the falls in a barrel.
        As far as I can see there is no leadership except for Sturgeon. The Bullingdon Club has broken the country and run away.
        Tim Farron looks like a man constantly haunted by the things he did in 'Nam.
        Starting to think Osborne will be found hanging from the rafters of some high class sex barn with a tangerine in his mouth.
