+         More recently, I've spoken to hackers who very clearly (and properly) in
+ dicate what they want on background, what they want on record
+         Others understand that journalists need to verify what they say, so prov
+ ide samples of data and appreciate why (some don't give af though)
+         Release strategies show a decent understanding of the media. Impact Team
+  sent well packaged data/statement to a well respected journo
+         But others are very sloppy, firing off half-arsed tweets or begs for cov
+ erage to journalists in public.
+         With any type of source who might not be familiar with interacting with
+ media, journalists might need to be explicit in the process
+         Anyway, it's when hackers deliberately factor their manipulation of the
+ media into their own operations when shit gets really interesting
+         And that's when journalists have to be hyper-aware they are being manipu
+ lated, and keep that in mind while reporting and writing
+         Not really much different from any other journalism. Every source has a
+ motive (not necessarily a bad thing) but you gotta acknowledge that

+         Thing is, it didn't (always) work. It's hard for a journalist to repeate
+ dly write 'hey! some unknown org got pwned!' (he wouldn't name them)
+         He failed: he assumed journalists would just cover a breach of an unknow
