        It is not rude to boo Pence at a B'way show. You don't get to try to legislate gay people out of existence then turn up to enjoy a musical.

        Mike Pence and I are the same age, yet he looks so much older than me. I guess that happens when you feast on the souls of the unborn.
        Good thing that Pence didn't see WEST SIDE STORY. He'd have the Sharks deported.

        .@Pinboard but if you do it often enough it interrupts your whole life and leaves you chilled to the bone..https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/799719817481551872 ... 
        Watching people today forget that Obama knows his constitutional law, and misinterpret his comment that he "can't pardon @snowden"
        Obama: " I can't pardon somebody who hasn't gone before a court and presented themselves." This is an ethical stance, not a statement of law
        It's also a pretty clear signal that he would pardon Snowden if he turned himself in
        Absolutely true. RT @vonbladet: @Pinboard He could start with Chelsea Manning if there is an actual point he wants to make.

        Under Trump, the House Oversight Committee can really benefit from the ambiguous meaning of that word
        Feels like just last week that the entire NYT front page was about Clinton's emails
        About 17,700 results for "cabinet of deplorables"
        Fun thought experiment: Cuban Missile Crisis, except with Trump and his advisers
        Trump needs to hear from a range of voices, not just Ivanka and her husband. Bring Tiffany into the cabinet.

        A good article on what the author calls "reactionary Keynesianism": https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/10/a-nightmare-scenario-for-progressives-under-a-trump-presidency/?utm_term=.178f6c508db3 ...  ..

        If Pence feels disrespected after being booed at 'Hamilton', he can always invoke the traditional remedy and challenge them to a duel.

        Meanwhile Trump is screwing over cattle producers. He would not thrive on a fight with them. http://www.aberdeennews.com/news/business/struggling-cattle-producers-seek-answers-in-tough-times/article_689088e1-3624-57ec-8345-65ef3fb8b08a.html ... 
        Opposing Trump on grounds of commercial freedom, economics, and trade is where he's most vulnerable.
        Trump is a showman. He *needs* a fight. The question is, are you going to give him the fight he wants or the one he doesn't?
        Exactly. This is actually a fight he doesn't want. It's why he settled.https://twitter.com/kyleshank/status/799980344179036160 ... 
        Exactly! That's the point. Pence went to see Hamilton! The show personifies obnoxious elitism.https://twitter.com/sarahussein/status/799980873298874368 ... 
        He's also managed to make the news today about Pence getting booed and not about the $25M fraud settlement #TrumpUhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/799979185989124100 ... 
        If Dem and GOP establishment elites weren't slobbering over $500 tickets to Hamilton, they would actually mock Pence for seeing it.
        Better headline --> Incoming VP Mike Pence goes to see elite Broadway show about America's first big banker as Trump settles fraud claims.
        Also, the finance friendly bill endorsed by Hamilton creator @Lin_Manuel is destroying Puerto Rico.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-18/puerto-rico-board-warns-deep-debt-cuts-needed-to-steady-island ... 
        Protests are good. Artists should protest. Hamilton is a $500 a ticket display of financial power, elitism, and bad history.
        roses are red
        Historians should have called bullshit on Chernow's horrible work and this play. But they are, like everyone else, cowed by power.
        Hamilton's quality as art doesn't make its politics less shitty or its history less dishonest. Teaching bad history is bad politics.
        There's a reason its creator backed a finance-friendly bill that was essentially a colonial takeover of Puerto Rico.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-18/puerto-rico-board-warns-deep-debt-cuts-needed-to-steady-island ... 
        Now if the cast member had said "Spending $500 to see this show the same day your boss settled his fraud suit for cheating ppl is wrong'...
        Mike Pence getting booed at Hamilton is the worst thing to ever happen to a politician at a play
        Please stop tweeting at me about Abraham Lincoln. I don't know who that is and I don't care

        Sure feels like now that Trump has won the election we're all turning our attention to our states, where most governing really happens. Whew

        Please stop sharing article that claims Trump's "rapist Mexicans" comment is surprisingly non-racist as "clear-eyed analysis".
