        Things that would've better served the American public with $1.3M than Comey's goose chase: Mental health funding.
        Comey basically said that he's glad they were able to buy a kidney and hopes this opens up a new market for all kinds of shady organ sales.

        PSA: You can get around libtool's stripping of -static from LDFLAGS by using LDFLAGS="-static --static".
        libtool takes over -static to mean "use static versions of package-internal libs", but passes thru --static to the compiler driver.
        And thankfully the compiler driver (at least gcc) accepts --static as an alias for -static.

        In public relations school, they must now teach politicians' press flacks to pretend the Internet & its fact-checking resources dont exist
        I love flacks who forget the Internet records stuff - like Cuomo not supporting $15 min wage https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150204/gramercy/cuomo-calls-minimum-wage-plan-non-starter-latest-salvo-against-mayor ... https://twitter.com/melissadderosa/status/723516431774547968 ... 
        Radical idea: read the actual article or do a 5 second Google search before you angrily comment. It tends to make ur comments more accurate.
        Hey Cuomo spox @melissadderosa: RT-ing a Clinton aide insulting me doesnt prove Cuomo originally backed $15 min wagepic.twitter.com/sAewotMNpm
        BTW this is a taxpayer-paid govt employee of Cuomo now promoting the Clinton campaign attacks on me. Seems legit...pic.twitter.com/hrHmLjGfP2
        Andrew Cuomo has always been firmly behind a $15 minimum wage...except when he wasn't, just last year.https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150204/gramercy/cuomo-calls-minimum-wage-plan-non-starter-latest-salvo-against-mayor ... 
        If Christie had only called me a "hack," dayenu. If Clinton aide only insulted me, dayenu. If Cuomo spox only promoted the insult, DAYENU.

        I really don't believe fuzzer corpus files are the best ways to transfer information between fuzzers and SMT solvers. It seems wrong.
        Vulnerability disclosure debate: "we need more data" is only partially correct in my view. Modeling is where we're failing.
        There are unknowns involved in vulnerability disclosure: we have an adversary, and it's their job to deprive us of data.
        If it were as simple as looking at the available data and choosing the best process, we wouldn't still be debating this 25 years later.
        State your assumptions. State your goals. State your expectations. Then start the debate.

        It's Wendy and Lisa I feel sorry for.
        I remember the time Prince came down my local on my 40th birthday and did 'Purple Rain' on the piano.
        My mum just rang and told me about the time Prince came to her bingo night and got three lines, then did 'When Doves Cry' on Frank's banjo.
        My dad's just sent a text saying how Prince used to have a local window cleaning round and would perform 'Sign O' the Times' on the spoons.
        Dean Gaffney once took me to a party where Prince performed '1999' on a unicycle on a trampoline while playing guitar with his bum cheeks.
        It's the Prince's Trust I feel sorry for.
