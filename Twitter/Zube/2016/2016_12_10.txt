        I've given around 20 talks this year.  Its funny that I've never been invited by a car company to speak.  I guess they're on top of things?
        I still remember at a panel discussion when I asked for more transparency from car industry about security and a rep from BMW said "Never!"
        ...and for those who wonder about tesla and their outreach program, neither me nor @nudehaberdasher have ever been contacted by them.

TeXtip

        The \url command in the url package formats URLs and emails, escaping special TeX symbols. Also extra careful about line breaks.
        Can add diacritical marks in TeX by preceding the letter with a backslash and an analogous symbol: \~ for tilde, \' for acute accent, etc.
        Example: jalape\~no -> jalapeÃ±ohttps://twitter.com/TeXtip/status/807269006906458113 ...

        Wondering how many Europeans realise that a change in the US' nuclear posture has profound implications. Back in the 50s Italy & Germany... 
        had started a joint program to create a "European Bomb" which was blocked by the US' assurance of a "nuclear umbrella". Similarly lots... 
        of countries in Europe had nuclear ambitions (UK & France actually fulfilled them): Switzerland had a nuke program into the 80s... 
        Now if the US decides that there is a "minimum acceptable nuke" the unwritten (or possibly secretly written down) understanding that a nuke... 
        would be lobbed only in the direst of circumstances (mainly Soviet invasion) plus the new "isolationist" stance might bring back ideas of... 
        an "independent EU deterrent". There is an inherent instability when such a momentous change in stance takes place.
        One should mention that the UK "independent deterrent" is based on US Trident missiles and allegedly a British warhead... 
        ...  the French, on the other hand, are rather more independent with "own design" of missiles & warheads.

        When Bill Clinton pushed for the expansion of NATO, he set in motion events that lead to Russias info-warfare against Western democracy.
        Instead of truly normalizing US-Russia relations after Cold War, Clinton admin. re-established adversarial dynamic.
        Putin has every reason as a rational actor to want to counter NATO: it invaded 3 countries in 15 yrs and is expanding on his borders.
