        And this is a perfect example of how Obama admin manipulates #FOIA  response data
        This is an epic troll by FBI
        FBI actually made a CD of blank pages in response to my #FOIA request. And they will get credit for making a partial disclosure.
        But at least I now know FBI has at least 487 pages of talking points given to Comey on encryption, Ferguson effect, et al

        Great job, @securitystreak. 
        A huge amount of security is simply knowing what's possible, to expand your mind to possibilities, that you can then carry to other areas.
        For example: Knowing about just SQL Injection in PHP makes you consider input safety and sanitization in every language and technology.

        in 2016, I also learned a lot about death, hate and depression (mine, and  others').
        I also learned a lot about books.
        my conclusion for 2016: do things your way.
        thanks, 2016: you hurt me so much I'm much stronger now.
        also, no more conferences attendance or presentation until I obtained satisfying results.

        @kennwhite @jedisct1 @jmgosney Not wrong, just overkill. "Wrong" would make you less secure. Overly long passwords don't decrease security.
        @jumbograms @kennwhite @jedisct1 this is slightly OT since the original topic is about passwd mgr-generated random password, BUT:
        @jumbograms @kennwhite @jedisct1 consider scenario where attempting to use a Diceware-esque passphrase on 1 of MANY sites that truncate pass
        @jumbograms @kennwhite @jedisct1 you think you're using a 6-word, 30 char phrase but really you have 2 words, 16 chars
        @jumbograms @kennwhite @jedisct1 in this scenario the overly long password does indeed harm security. Slightly OT but relevant

        Journalists: Your headlines are all that many people read. It doesn't help to put Trump's lies in headline and "correct" them lower down.
        Insult contests turn out to be a good way to encourage small boys' imaginations and teach them new words.
        The only industries with more scandals than tech are all the others.
        Inexperienced investors don't realize network effects can sometimes take years to kick in, and those startups can end up worth the most.
        Startup investing is unlike nearly all past forms of investing in that the big mistake is not choosing investments that lose money.
        In startup investing, the big mistake is not choosing startups that fail (that's inevitable) but turning down the big winners.
