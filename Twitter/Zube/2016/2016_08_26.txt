        Mylan charging different prices based on ability to pay is discriminatory pricing and solely reflects market power.
        Their initial argument about how much they've improved the product was a lie. They know it. We know it. They know we know it. All PR.
        This is dumb, but there's some truth to middleman role played by pharmacy benefit managers http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/business/epipen-mylan-price.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0 ... pic.twitter.com/GH5vhUWaoW
        The biggest problem with pricing games like this is that they incentivize buying patents and doing pricing games instead of making medicine.
        Mylan sounds like a bank that happens to trade medicine and patents instead of financial instruments.
        What Mylan does is absolutely industry standard. Aggressive price increases every year. No innovation. It's the model.
        1. A note about #PayforPlay: even if there were quid pro quo at Clinton Foundation -- and no evidence exists that there was -- but if ...
        2. if there were #PayforPlay, it would *not* be the same as what lobbyists with politicians. Politicians trade votes for $$$. This is not...
        3. what happened at Clinton Found'n. If Clinton did trade access for $$$ -- & no there's evidence she did -- it was for others, not herself.
        4. In other worlds, Clinton Foundation was vast wealth redistribution mechanism, forcing wealth downward. Which brings me to a new point.
        5. We have become much to in thrall to purity & too sensitive to the appearance of corruption. Deals must be made, problems must be solved.
        6. I don't like the idea of hobnobbing with Crown Princes any more than next person, but if their wealth can be put to good use, so be it.
        7. If Clintons were pocketing all/most of $$$ for themselves, that's one thing. But some 80% of $$$ goes to those who need it. That's good.
        Mylan CEO is right about one thing, it is an entire supply chain problem.http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/25/mylan-expands-epipen-cost-cutting-programs-after-charges-of-price-gouging.html ... 
        "No one's more frustrated than me." -- Mylan CEO Heather Bresch. Um, I can think of a few people.http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/25/mylan-expands-epipen-cost-cutting-programs-after-charges-of-price-gouging.html ... 
        hence why the stock is up 4% todayhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/768807522916446210 ... 
        That the Epipen is off patent yet still a monopoly suggests that we shouldn't have allowed generic makers to merge.
        There aren't enough generic drug makers. Here's the FTC allowing yet another merger in the generic space. https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/ftc-requires-teva-divest-over-75-generic-drugs-rival-firms-settle ...
