        Monthly reminder that the vendor FUD in the security industry is harmful.
        I've started collecting paranoid CONFIG, sysctl, and kernel command line options since people ask from time to time: http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project#Recommended_settings ... 
        So, the assertion that security doesn't matter if it doesn't have a stock impact is one which really kind of bothers me.https://twitter.com/etherealmind/status/781957627752374272 ... 
        Leaving aside the whole business of "the stock price encodes all the info you need to know about a company" claptrap, it's somewhat...off.
        First, the stock price isn't going to reflect the internal costs that the business is forced to expend for incident response.
        Nor will it reflect the missed opportunities for business expansion that may come up during the recovery period that cannot be leveraged..
        ...because of the distraction of DFIR.
        But, most of all, it does not reflect the costs that get passed on to the account holders.
        Yes, the business does not incur these costs directly, but the account holders who are affected now cannot spend those dollars on the biz.
        So you have essentially crippled your continuing income stream.
        Stock markets don't care about this information because they don't yet understand how it is relevant to a business.
        This is perhaps something that may change over time.
        But to assert, based on the single metric of stock price alone, that security doesn't matter?
        [ I have very deliberately made -only- business profitability arguments in this thread. ]
        [ This is purposeful ]
