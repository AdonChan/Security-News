        @c7zero I'm curious, how did you sanity check the current sigs? running on all the patched and unpatched versions mentioned in advisories?
        @XenoKovah it looks for GUID string of SmmRuntime protocol. If found in any binary then consider vulnerable (even if binary consumes prot)
        The fact that @wire ticks the crypto boxes does not mean it does "the right thing" for e.g. forensics or indeed other aspects like RCE.

        His claims about Foxconn deliberately blocking Linux were untrue (http://mjg59.livejournal.com/96625.html ), and he responded withhttp://mjg59.livejournal.com/97151.html 
        Summary: This guy has a history of making over the top accusations, and responds badly when called on it. Don't enable him.
        @mjg59 I chatted to the BM team and learnt that the process addresses ILOM/EEPROM/NVMe and FPGA secure wipe. Fascinating stuff.
        @mjg59 it's worth noting our deprov process is quite a bit longer than our prov process for just this reason.  Lots more to do.

        So, defeating this 'un is very doable if you have the resources to build a honeypot image that looks like a standard image for your org.
        Or if you can image drives that've been compromised and use those for the test environment.
        Slightly more complex, to be sure.
        Called a landline and got a telco message stating it was busy. Realized its cuz there are now ppl who don't know what a busy signal is.
        Apparently Krebs' ability to spite s'kiddies is strong enough that they blow operational cover entirely to get back at him.
        Which is kind of impressive. That's some very strong kung fu.
        It's a pity that the CFAA makes it utterly illegal, but this would be a -fantastic- time to build an op to take down that botnet...
        ...because the ongoing attack provides a view of what devices are compromised, and it'd be easy to find and mitigate those compromises.
        We could take down a -massive- attack surface by tweaking the scripts installed on them to deny routes outbound.
        But, unfortunately, anyone who did that would likely be pursued even more than these idiots will be.
