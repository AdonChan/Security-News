        It's so fucking awesome to have smart followers
        @SwiftOnSecurity @cstross To be even more fair, to the extent explosions are involved, you want them at a test site & nowhere near the pad.
        $200 million payload on board means this is going to be a setbackhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/spacex-loses-rocket-200-million-satellite-in-test-fire-explosion ... 
        So, in retrospect, my assumption that they don't do testing with the payload aboard was incorrect, and I spread misinformation about this.
        Fucking Dunning--Kruger.
        @SwiftOnSecurity It's a customer decision,most of the time they dont test with the payload. Someone is regretting this decision right now.

        Had my security students write a binary search program on paper w/o a computer. It's a cruel and humbling exercise I stole from Jon Bentley.
        It's a great exercise because everyone is super confident they can correctly do this until they actually try.
        A bit surprised at the number of people who believe defense can be learned separately from offense. Maybe it can; I don't know how.
        I suspect part of it is a timidness about teaching how to do "bad" things. But that's probably a futile goal anyway.
        @mattblaze I tell my students "If you don't understand how to use social media to commit a crime, you don't understand that medium at all."
        I should point out that I teach my students to pick locks, which makes the campus locksmith practically apoplectic with rage.
        As far as I know, none of them have ever actually committed a burglary, FWIW.
        Remember when they were saying 56 bit keys were beyond the reach of NSA?https://twitter.com/hashcat/status/770649376955990016 ... 

        In particular, a practical $5K DES cracker shows the futility of trying to find an "optimal" crypto key size that only a gov't can crack.
        Whatever the key cracking economics are today, just wait a few years. Crypto strength is basically everyone or no one. No middle ground.
        There's still a LOT of DES out there.  56 bits is the new 40 bits.
        This is why proposals to "limit" crypto strength are so misguided. Key escrow is dumb and dangerous, but this is dumber and dangerouser.
        Also, bad decisions on crypto keys and algorithms last a LONG time; they get embedded in standards and supported for backward compatibility.
        The ease of cracking short keys should not come as some kind of out-of-the-blue surprise. It's following the curve everyone predicted.
        There ARE occasional disruptive surprises in crypto and cryptanalysis. The decreasing cost of exhaustive key search is not one of them.
