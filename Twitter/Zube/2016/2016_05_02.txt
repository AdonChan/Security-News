        Clinton isn't exactly popular. In fact, quite unpopular. I don't remember the last poll that had positive rating greater than her negative.
        .@trenchman003 Here's one where a unpopular R beat an unpopular D: 2014 FL Gov.
        One of the big advantages Trump had in the primary was that in a multi-candidate field he had a core group of folks that loved him. (1/2)
        That changes in the general where he'll have a far larger core group of people who hate him. I stress though that he still can win. (2/2)

        Just in case anybody was wondering, the PSK for Samsung smart home devices in setup mode appears to be "1111122222"
        Massively obfuscated chain of calls that can just be hooked to dump the result. What's the point?
        (The password for Samsung's smart home client cert appears to be "1%^tka1zvbta14km")
        The password for the keystore bundles included with the app is "F4#by]!K[m9ApIO"
        Cool. The vacuum cleaner demands an SSL client cert, but once you've got an auth token it doesn't matter *which* SSL client cert
        The vacuum cleaner runs nginx. 1.2.7.
