        We just had our very first security vulnerability/report delivered to us by @botnet_hunter.  He found a nasty bug in the RPC server... 
        That essentially allows RCE since the RPC server binds to 0.0.0.0.  The impact of this is being limited currently by binding the RPC... 
        server to 127.0.0.1.  This modification has been pushed out, so please update your Veil-Evasion code.  We will next focus on the... 
        bigger issue.  However, the exposure should now be limited.  Thanks again to @botnet_hunter for the report!

        Oh wow, @cyberbgone just retired from the US Army. Congratulations, and all the best for a long and interesting (in a good way) retirement!
        I wish apple would make their Lightning/USB cables even half as robust as the security of the handsets they connect to.
        Seriously, why do these cables break so damn easily?
        I might not be the world's worst copyeditor, but damn, I'm bad at this.
        I can tell there's a debate on TV because half my timeline is people saying things in disbelief.
        That was fast... https://twitter.com/Riana_Crypto/status/715044103134773249 ... 
        Room for Debate: Should Hackers Help the F.B.I.? http://nyti.ms/22NOrPk  w/ me, @mattblaze @fmkaplan @k8em0
        My NYT mini-op-ed: Constantly Bolstering Security is Vital http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/03/30/should-hackers-help-the-fbi/constantly-bolstering-computer-security-is-vital ...  (w/ companion pieces by @k8em0 @AlanInDC & @fmkaplan)
        Also, the astute reader will note that neither me, @k8em0, nor @AlanInDC had a single "cyber" in our pieces. @fmkaplan let one slip in.
        Should Hackers Help the F.B.I.? http://nyti.ms/22Nx1Cp 
        Will the next All Writs unlock order to Apple will be as technically detailed as the (now vacated) SB one? That was good reading.
        bigger q: will it be sealed? https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/715213368873893889 ... 
        If anything, the SB case demonstrates how far away we are from FBI's nightmare crypto scenario. Even w/o iPhone, they left enormous trail.
        If the SB shooting had happened 20 years earlier, the FBI would know FAR less about their movements & contacts than they do now.
        If Lee Harvey Oswald had carried even a properly encrypted iPhone, the Warren Commission would have had a much easier job.
        Now that they've unlocked the phone, I hope everyone is preparing for the inevitable activation of the cyber pathogen #doomdoomdoom

        @mjg59 Do not trust the crypto you invented. Do not trust the crypto you implemented. Do not trust the ethics you wrote up in your blog.
        There are only two hard things in Computer Science: knowing how to admit you're wrong and apologizing when you are.
        There is no longer any reason for enterprise server vendors to target Win32
        Where there's a performance disparity, Microsoft are going to be under huge pressure to change that
        The amount of money vendors could save by reducing the code they have to maintain for cross-platform apps is immense
        If Oracle v. Google stands, does this mean that Windows is now a derivative work of Linux?

        Was testing a new 1U chassis PSU, triggered RCD. Faulty PSU? No, turns out when my old power cord is bent a certain way, it shorts N to GND.
        Luckily, I didn't plug the Schuko the other way: I could have damaged my power meter. BTW, the PSU eats +0.2W when GND is connected vs. not.
