        Fact is, Brits may not want #brexit but voted and need to eat their own dog food. Another referendum would harm the integrity of democracy.

        Waking up to the news that SCOTUS did something sensible should't be such a rare cause for celebration, but I'll take it.
        The Tx abortion clinic law struck down today was awful: punitive and cynically justified as protecting the very people it was harming.
        Some say a perpetual motion machine is impossible. But as energy prices rise, demand for one will grow, so we'd best start building one now.

        @AFP @matthewstoller EU rolling into these negotiations loaded for bear. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a308a612-3b8c-11e6-8716-a4a71e8140b0.html?desktop=true#axzz4CjXw71hG ... 
        Brexit is a reminder some things just shouldn't be decided by the people - The Washington Posthttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/27/brexit-is-a-reminder-some-things-just-shouldnt-be-decided-by-the-people/ ... 
        Elite headline of the day.....https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/747408029897875456 ... 
        Greenspan on Bloomberg radio: 'If we went back on the gold standard...We'd be fine...I'm known as a gold bug and everyone laughs at me."
        Wow. Apparently the Blairites hate #Corbyn over Leave because he refused to allow any anti-immigrant rhetoric.
        S&P Futures back to 1985pic.twitter.com/uYzEknphOI
        .@HillaryClinton 's five Econ goals: 1) Jobs + 2) Debt free college + 3) Profit sharing + 4) Wealthy pay fair share + 5) Families first
        This really seems like proving the point about how the EU is/has become an anti-democratic project.https://twitter.com/ap/status/747439707475279873 ... 
        I'm generally against voter suppression, but taking the franchise away from people who share Borowitz links would be sound policy.
        This seems like a big deal. Tory faction goes anti-China.https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/747458525656408064 ... 
        So S&P has cut the UK's credit rating on the same day that yields on 10-year UK bonds have dropped below 1 percent for the first time ever.
        S&P downgraded UK bonds from AAA even though England can print its own currency. Reminds me of this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c ... 
        In 2011, S&P downgraded US from AAA. WH pointed out they made a $2T arithmetic error. Zoink.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sandp-considering-first-downgrade-of-us-credit-rating/2011/08/05/gIQAqKeIxI_story.html ... 
        Then of course there was this little episode in 2007-2008, when S&P had slapped good ratings on subprime mortgages.http://www.cnbc.com/id/27321998 
        A: That deal is ridiculous... We should not be rating it. 
        More of the story. S&P is super credible. Believe them, always.
        And there was this episode in 2003, after Georgia passed a predatory lending law b/c of increase of mortgage fraud. http://www.asreport.com/issues/2003_05/164368-1.html ... 
        In 2003 S&P used its power to roll back the Georgia legislature's law against mortgage fraud. I wonder what happened next. Probably nothing.
        In other words, S&P is just terrific. Good people, smart insight, apolitical, and most of all, ahead of the curve.
        Hey nerd, S&P just downgraded your face.

        The best crypto I've seen so far in a random cheap IoT device is in a Bluetooth lightbulb where it doesn't matter at all
        Annoyingly, it's also the only vaguely competent cheap IoT lightbulb I've found
        I'll admit to not being entirely sure why it's generating a session key when everything is just AES
        As in, it obtains an AES key, it generates a random key, it encrypts it with the first key and hands it back, the random key is then used

        Third: the police have free reign to go out and punch the fuck out of racists. Fourth: tell Jeremy Corbyn to buck up or fuck off.

        Dave's going to get his arse handed to him by the EU tomorrow.
        It's good that after three days of uncertainty Cameron has made a statement doing nothing whatsoever to clear anything up.
        After that statement from Dave, if there was a military coup now, I'd feel a bit more optimistic about things.
