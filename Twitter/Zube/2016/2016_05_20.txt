        Should be another great car hacking talk at @BlackHatEventshttps://twitter.com/nudehaberdasher/status/733019912810188803 ... 
        I'm trying to figure out if the lack of car hacking talks at BH is because it's too easy/been done or a solved problem.
        This year will be my tenth talk at Blackhat over the last ten years.  I have to find a better hobby.

        Yeah too bad i couldn't go to qualcomm (again)
        And @AppStore @tim_cook let another scam app using our company logo into the appstore. This time 5 times the price..https://twitter.com/sanguis_malus/status/733179406517174272 ... 
        And another @appstore legal content dispute complaint filed...
        I wonder how much 30% of the revenue of all those fraud apps is that Apple lets into the @AppStore @tim_cook .
        @i0n1c yep plenty of those fraud apps still in @Appstore
        easiest way to infect iOS users with malware is to search web for messages about pulled app and then just submit malware with same name.
        . @pdp the point here is that Apple has absolutely no automatic safeguards against 1:1 icon theft
        . @pdp and that although they have a rule that they will pull apps with too similar icons
        I am very confused - my iphone has free ROMpic.twitter.com/8GMlOQ67RH

        Ohh this confusionpic.twitter.com/TQObyXT8gh
        . @anmol_malhotra4 yeag why is iOS reporting wrong battery stats???
        . @azonenberg no it just uses private IOKit APIs
        Is there an up todate list of high profile apps with jailbreak detections? #AskingForAFriend
        @i0n1c I actually managed to successfully submit an app to the AppStore which (accidentally) used a Apple icon. Their review process sucks.
        @i0n1c Wow this is crazy, another fraud:pic.twitter.com/ToTmvmvlb2
        .@jevinskie when you sign an app for your private use (dev/enterprise) its codedir is still sha1 but 
        . @jevinskie but that is not my point. My point is if syscall() function is in public SDK headers allowed,saying it is private API is shitty
        . @jevinskie the syscall that i am calling that offends them so much doesn't even have hooks to be sandboxable
        . @Razzilient  our app got killed because it shows that Apple does care so much about your privacy that 3 lines of testcode is too much
        @i0n1c @jevinskie lots of game devs use syscall to add PT_DENY_ATTACH to their app so I don't see why you aren't allowed to use it
        kinda amazing how many tech journalists are live tweeting their tour of a new Apple Store
        just because apple gives you access doesn't mean you should become their PR vehicle
        While working on a blogpost i found something hilarious  means at some point i have to write another blogpost

        Lazyweb: Looking for a digital audio recorder controllable by a simple contact closure circuit (like old cassette recorders had). Anything?
        So far all the modern digital recorders I can find use proprietary remote controls. I just want to use a DC switch.
        Thanks, all, for the pointers. Short answer is there's no current production inexpensive digital recorder w/ straight up contact closure.
        Best option if you need contact closure seems to be to build a (simple) remote circuit for the Marantz PMD620MKII. Or a used PMD670.
        It's crazy that no one seems to support contact closure control anymore, outside of specialized pro recording gear. Used to be universal.

        One of the most important parts of making a project accessible to new developers is a rich revision history that tells a story
        It should be possible to see the development of a feature over a series of commits - add types, add infrastructure, add the functionality
        Squashing your commits into a single "Add new feature" makes that impossible. Don't do it.
        For everything wrong with Linux kernel development culture, this is one thing they do right - small commits that create a narrative
        And don't use "Oh, we reviewed it in small commits and *then* squashed" as an excuse - review doesn't stop after merge.
        But yes absolutely do this. "I made a mistake and I fixed it" doesn't increase clarity later on.https://twitter.com/BlueSpaceCanary/status/733368496508284928 ... 
        @mjg59 also things like "refactor & tidy" should be separate from "change behaviour / add new feature" and can be reviewed by different ppl

        1) Officially, in 2012 Linkedin
        2) There were one or more class-action lawsuits against Linkedin. How will this new information affect that?
        3) I wonder if Linkedin does have some pwd history stored, so they can better check for pwd reuse for all accounts 2012 -> 2016.
        4) I really expect Linkedin to clearly recommend 2SV config for (all) affected users, and make it an optional part of the signup process.

        What's really objectionable about Trump isn't that he's a grifter, but that his grifts are so grimy, transparent and smalltime.

        Are we really pretending that Trump has SCOTUS picks? We can't just call those the expert-generated GOP marketing document that they are?
