        Assholes using a typical compare apples with oranges attack.
        The irony is that those attacking me because of patchfinder did not speak up against pangu or taig...
        What energy people put into defending plagiarism by the fried apple team.
        Imagine the same guys arguing that it suxx code is BSD licensed because they favor GPL.
        At this point the only person i discuss having shown patchfinder modifications during a training 2 years ago with is @planetbeing himself.
        . @timb_machine oh yeah i haven't worked on that project forever.
        Thankfully there are still people in infosec that respect other people's work.
        At this point I also want to thank the company that asked before they incorporated my code even though that one was BSD licensed. Right way!

        Not talking about anyone in particular, but I think maybe we should add "takes criticism well" to the list of qualifications for president.
        Even in 2016, extraordinary claims still require evidence.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664 ... 
        Trump's overseas business interests mean foreign government's have direct financial leverage over the president.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/politics/donald-trump-international-business.html ... 
        I'm not sure how anyone can defend that. It's pretty much a DEFINITION of a serious conflict of interest.
        And now, of course, the "but Clinton is exactly the same" nonsense.
        Basically, he'll be making foreign policy decisions that he will know might either cost him, or make him, millions of dollars.
        Imagine President Trump in 1959. The incoming Castro government is considering whether to nationalize the Havana Trump Resort and Casino.
        But I'm sure that little detail would have no influence on our policy in Cuba, right?
        I think the fundamental problem is that Trump's base doesn't care, and Trump doesn't care about satisfying anything other than his base.
        That said, I find it supremely weird that his base doesn't care about foreign influence. Seems like a red-meat issue.
        President being controlled by foreign governments seems only a hair's breath from the "one world government" conspiracies of Infowars, etc.
        We're seeing end-of-first-term-Nixon-level paranoia and he hasn't even taken office yet.
        In less than 2 months, they take away his phone. Then he'll have to send this stuff on classified nets to people sworn to follow his orders.
        Think of it as fuzz testing our democracy.
        Alternatively, 4 years of "bring your petulant teenager to work" day at the White House.
        The discussion seems to have narrowed to whether the international conflicts of interest are more worrisome than the unhinged crazy tweets.
        I'm agnostic on this. Happy to be equally freaked out by both.
        I will note that giving someone enormous power while surrounding them by sycophants is not historically great for a person's mental health.

        Forbes has a sad.

        "Claw back all depreciation allowances for the past decade? Did they legalise weed in Vermont when I wasn't looking?"
        Oh wow, this Forbes writer is a British former candidate for the UKIP anti-immigration party. Hahaha.https://eziwrestler.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/tim-worstall-curious-british-attack-dog/ ...

        Oh you think?https://twitter.com/WSJCentralBanks/status/803268893955543040 ... 
        Economics might actually be the study of making obvious observations years after normal people do.http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/23/how-china-trade-could-help-explain-rising-mortality-among-white-middle-aged-men/?mod=e2twcb ...

        it is very ironic that Visual Studio calls its files "solutions" because every time I have to load it it's cause I've got problems
        So, there's some mention that the 'exempt worker overtime rule' that goes into effect on 1-DEC might get reversed - this'll impact devs.
        I think that a suitable response for developers would be to organize together in small corporate entities - "mercenary companies"
        This would allow them much more collective bargaining power, and thus better working conditions.
        Additionally, it'd allow for a better distributed workforce, and apprenticeship-type situations where people can learn the trade.
        Pairing experienced developers with relative neophytes would pay off in spades, and eliminate a lot of training chokepoints.
        And it'd let larger companies hire on units that are already cohesive without having to rebuild teams between projects.
        It's a win-win type situation, really, and I'd recommend devs who work well together look into this.

        Periodically the @BreitbartNews / alt-right twittosphere has this spasm where they start retweeting the late Andrew #Breitbart --1
        These spasms often trigger waves of angst-ridden tweets at me because Andrew tweeted at me several times on the last day of his life --2
        This latest spasm makes references to the bizarre #PizzaGate online phenomenon --3
        Disturbingly people have begun tweeting mentions of me with erroneous claims about my criminal history --4
        To clarify: I was arrested in 2004 for "Animal Enterprise Terrorism" & spent some of my time in a Federal Prison w/ designated terrorists --5
        The charges made against me have no connection to The Huffington Post & not a thing to do w/  John Podesta, the Democrats or #PizzaGate --6
