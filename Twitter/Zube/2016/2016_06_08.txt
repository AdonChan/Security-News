        It's 2016 and we're actually debating:
        @mattblaze Also who can got potty where.
        Am I famous enough to ask all of you to please assume that any bodies found buried in my backyard were planted there by the government?
        (Above is an entirely hypothetical request.  Yes, totally hypothetical).
        Anyway, just let me assure you that I don't know anything about any bodies that might in the future be found buried in my yard.
        Randomly scheduled mattblaze transparency report: 0 secret orders, 0 systems secretly compromised, 0-499 bodies buried.
        The hacker community was the first place where I felt  truly welcome, at home, and allowed to thrive in my own way. 1/
        It's what I cherish most about this community, and what I feel most instinctively protective of when it seems threatened. 2/
        One thing that's amply clear, regardless of the details of any specific incident, is that there are parts of our community ... 3/
        ... where some aren't allowed to thrive and feel at home in the way I and many others have. Instead, they're made to feel unsafe. 4/
        There's urgent need right now not for pitchforks and torches, but for all of us to take a good look around and .... 5/
        ... extend a hand to someone us who might not be getting the same welcome that we got (or should have gotten. 6/
        There will be time to sort out accusations of bad behavior. But we need not wait for that to make this a safer place to be a geek. 7/
        I'm sorry if I'm being long winded and preachy here.  But I think our community is in a genuine state of crisis. Thanks for listening. 8/8
        TFW you discover something a friend would love to learn about, and then remember that they're dead. Sigh.
        Draft of our law review paper on metadata & content now up: http://www.crypto.com/papers/complicated.pdf ...  (with @SteveBellovin, Susan Landau, @StephanieKPell)
        Note that our paper is technical for a law paper and policy-laden for a tech paper. Something to confuse everyone, as the title reflects.
        Every time I work on a law review paper and am forced under duress to use MS Word, I marvel at how lawyers get anything written.
        Tl;dr of our paper: The Internet is blurring the content/metadata distinction into meaninglessness. http://www.crypto.com/papers/complicated.pdf ...

        Is there a (statistical) graph relating the amount of fee vs. expected time to get at least, say 6, confirmations for a BTC transaction?
        IOW, how much one needs to make the fee to get their BTC transaction done fast (i.e. minutes vs hours)?
        If you got lots of bitcoins to spend, what organizations (which support donations in BTC) would you support? #AskingForAFriend
