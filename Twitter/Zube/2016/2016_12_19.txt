        I wonder why my AppleTV suddenly has the AccorHotels app installed. I only downloaded it on my iPhone and suddenly the AppleTV had it too
        In the last days I gained a few hundred followers... how do they know about my secret project?
        The AppleTV I am giving away is an AppleTV 4 that was bought a year ago and is still in plastic. Should run old jailbreakable TvOS.
        Here is what I give away to eliminate all misunderstandingspic.twitter.com/Lp96UBTOHg
        Yes as long you are in a country that actually has a working mail system I will send this AppleTV to you.
        Now all I have to figure out is how to extract the list of my followers and then randomly pick a winner.
        Oh yeah. Your country needs to have a public mail delivery system and must not be on some kind of embargo list. 
        Oh yeah in order to win you need to record a video of yourself saying "@keemstar is the best YouTuber of all times." Haha, just kidding.
        Is there a website that will tell you for Month X what countries are best to visit for vacation? (Like: no it is not rain season over there)
        Our joy comes from the confidence we have that the Lord is close to us with his tenderness, mercy, forgiveness and love.
        When you google for best vacation spot in Month X you get suggestions like "Hawaii because there is no bad timing to go to Hawaii"

        I mean, it was broken back in March and hasn't gotten better since, but this is just ludicrous.

        Talked to UN official just returned from #SouthSudan this week - said everything in place for genocide, beginning stages already have begun.
        So, driving down the road today I had an interesting thought - different autonomous vehicles will implement standards differently.
        Which is a very obvious thought to have if you've ever looked at two competing implementations of, frankly, anything.
        However, the emergent behaviors arising from this are likely to cause some -very- strange situations.
        Consider wifi - it's a relatively well understood and commonly implemented set of standards. Most things should do it right, right?
        However, if you have certain Android versions, you -cannot- connect to a WPA2 network put up by a Cisco WAP.
        This is because of some odd details of implementation that differ -just- enough b/t Android and Cisco's implementations to cause failure.
        Now consider how this will apply to autonomous vehicles - vehicle brand A will implement any standards per A; brand B per B, etc.
        So when a given edge case - say, a deer crossing the rode - happens, brand A will react in one fashion and B in another fashion.
        What happens when you have a freeway full of these vehicles and some exception case happens, triggering a whole -bunch- of reactions?
        The emergent effects are going to be utterly fascinating to analyze, and I hope I'm nowhere -near- any such events.
        So, perhaps it'd behoove autonomous vehicle manufacturers to get together and decide how to mitigate such potential emergent interactions.
        'cuz if they don't, we're going to end up with some very peculiar pileups happening without apparent root cause.

        The problem with that is that spending more will get you higher-quality bugs, but also scales up amount of low-quality stuff you get.
        Every. Single. Person. I've talked to that runs a bounty has a lament about the amount of effort it takes to triage crap submissions.
        (also: open secret about bug bounty platforms is that they run lucrative side-businesses outsourcing the triage work they generate)
        I'm the weirdo who thinks the IC should probably not be briefing the electoral college.
        F'rinstance, @baconmeteor is fond of saying that politics in the American tradition might end if Trump takes office.
        ...  but using the offices of the current administration to alter the outcome of a completed election would DEFINITELY do that.

        I am so tired of people treating mass deportations and a Muslim registry as some kind of lefty hysteria. They're *campaign promises*.

        No SFBA tech company creates a Muslim registry because they want to. It's TERRIBLE for business.
        They feel about Muslim registries the way the Mafia feels about civilian casualties: avoid when possible.
        .@codinghorror @mattsiegel @Pinboard What's frantic about the pledge? Developers should have begun organizing a LONG time ago.
