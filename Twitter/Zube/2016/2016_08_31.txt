        @tqbf Ok. Let's do it. Under what circumstances can you not use bind variables? (There are a few)
        @tqbf or when the table name or column names are not known in advance. How often do you see this?

        Journos shouldnt have to explain why they scrutinize politicians. Pols' supporters should have to defend their efforts to stop the scrutiny.
        If you don't agree with this truism, you might feel more at home in an autocratic country with state-run media.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/770615812071620612 ... 
        Reminder: "The Clinton Foundation is an innocuous as the Red Cross" isn't a great argument - just ask @JustinElliotthttps://www.propublica.org/article/disturbing-things-about-the-red-crosss-sandy-relief-efforts ... 
        He's right -- when we published this in 2015, nobody had ever reported it http://www.ibtimes.com/firms-paid-bill-clinton-millions-they-lobbied-hillary-clinton-1899107 ... https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/770617085865041920 ... 
        I'm amazed this story hasn't gotten more attention. This is corporate money that went to the Clintons personally.http://www.ibtimes.com/firms-paid-bill-clinton-millions-they-lobbied-hillary-clinton-1899107 ... 
        @davidsirota Vox has probably made more revenue scoffing at AP's investigative journalism than AP made for investigation itself.

        Theory: many Dem pundits are now willing to promote cartoonish pro-Clinton PR because they bet they'll be rewarded by a President Clinton.

        So Apple says "you can have taxes, or you can have jobs". 14bn in taxes or 5k jobs over 5 years... Hmmm.... what's the better deal?
        Unless Apple pays more than 550k USD average annual salary in Ireland, they shouldn't IMO threaten "taxes or jobs"...

        Corp tax reform proposal: 15% on pre-tax profits as reported to Wall St. Doesn't matter where you pay as long as in aggregate you reach 15%.
        This would btw be a tax cut for every US business not engaged in tax arbitrage.
        It would bring in several billions per year from Apple and Google alone.

        From my mentions it looks like while i was sleeping a malware app that performs a jailbreak was allowed into the @AppStore 
        Not really shocked: once the malware guys realize that the @appstore checks are overhyped by media the store will be flooded with malware
        I said it a hundred times and i say it again: Apple @appstore checks are for control and bullying and for tricking gullible reporters
        @i0n1c @AppStore It totally proves the argument you've been making to Apple app review process isn't for security, just bullying developers
        Lets see how many scammers will now resign the jailbreak app and reupload in their own @AppStore dev accounts
        Did anyone screenshot the @appstore page of the jailbreak/malware that Apple let into the @appstore ?

        Crackpots yell about evoting systems being deliberately rigged, which is silly. Just ordinary, weak systems in an extraordinary application.
        Every generation thinks its successors are lazy, frivilous and ruining everything, but millennials seem to be getting an extra dose of it.
        I guess this is generational projection, given that, really, it was mostly us who ruined everything for the millennials.
        Millennials can take satisfaction in the fact that they'll eventually be dancing on our graves. Or, more likely, hiring dancers to do that.
        Just in case, maybe we should build a giant shield and make HD164595b pay for it.

        @matthewstoller all humans are self interested, whether they admit it or not. only minority portion are corrupt in any given profession imo
        This isn't a partisan debate. The is a powerful strain on both sides of the aisle asserting that 'the system' overpowers human agency.
        So Europe has 8 different kinds of Epipens in the market. http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/ ... 
        @matthewstoller yes but European regulators are all self-interested and corrupt

        I wish they'd make a Batman movie that explores why he does what he does. Did something happen to make him this way?  What's his deal?
        This is a useful perspective from @mcuban.http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-hillary-bill-clinton-foundation-2016-8 ... 
        This story by @mattyglesias is interesting precisely because he doesn't define what he means by corruption.http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/8/30/12690444/alma-powell-clinton-foundation ... 
        There's a general assumption that everyone just agrees on the definition of corruption. But they don't!
        And it is perfectly possible to be have this debate entirely through the private sector. Monopoly power can be a kind of corruption, or not!
        One of the most interesting elements of Zephyr's book is she argues that antitrust is an important anti-corruption measure.
        Glass-Steagall, for instance, addresses conflicts of interest among private financial institutions.

        Some very major investigative stories on a weird global corporate conspiracy that is actually true.
        This story by Buzzfeed tracks a "parallel legal universe" only for corporations to break laws they don't like.https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrishamby/super-court ...

        This system, called ISDS, is a malignant outgrowth of what was once an attempt to prevent global war.http://www.salon.com/2013/09/20/elites_strange_plot_to_take_over_the_world/ ... 
        The idea was 'let's bind countries together with foreign investment and they won't fight with each other'.
        It has turned into this dystopian nightmare of bureaucracy and corruption. But the trade negotiators think of themselves as peaceniks.

        And they will probably end up harming your overall reputation, especially if they make poor decisions but blame 'em on you.
        So if you own a business, carefully consider whether a client is worth the trouble.
        And if you serve customers, consider whether your boss will support you in cases where a client needs to be fired.
        @munin they'll demand freebies, they'll neglect to pay invoices on time...
        This doesn't mean you shouldn't be polite and serve customers.
        Like that anecdote I saw the other day said - 
        They can't get the product or service without dealing with you, so they, too, need a minimum level of civility to do business.
