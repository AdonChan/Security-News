        One day I figured out IT is there to service the users, not just sit in a cube and get pissed at them for liking anime fandubs
        I'm not joking. Every single corporate Windows computer has VLC preinstalled and centrally updated in our regular patch cycle.
        All our corporate Linux machines come with a hammer, sickle, and copy of Der Moderne Kapitalismus

        The only model a lot of new IT admins have for security is just restrict everything. Synthetic, theoretical attack surface is only metric.
        I'd rather have an attack surface I actively master the intricacies of and manage than just make a computer a brick. Maybe I'm wrong idk.
        I apply the same configs users get to my own machine. I take laptops home to play with. My decisions impact a big part of people's lives.
        I'm just making this up as I go. I don't have unlimited resources. My security changes are bundled into bringing visible value to business.

        Our users would search the Internet, downloading adware and malicious software trying to play videos Windows Media Player didn't support.
        I had years of experience in a basically unmanaged environment with terrible antivirus so I've seen all the ways users infect themselves.
        Basically, I don't play the corporate security game of just turning stuff off and blaming users. I play dirty for actual results.
        I'm a terrible security person, but I'm not the one cleaning up viruses on executive machines all the time anymore so whatever.
        @SwiftOnSecurity one of the companies I worked with reduced IT cost/junk malware by ~90% by having 'fluff' in official app catalog.
        @SwiftOnSecurity lots of young call center/creative type employees = going to search for stuff even if not admin. Tons of PUA etc.
        @SwiftOnSecurity you have to then maintain iTunes etc or it's more risk, but a lot less risk than dodgy search results/USB sticks/Gatak.
        Recently a user complained to their boss our security policies broke stuff. They never even called, assumed we would say no/were useless.
        I took ticket, talked with them directly, diagnosed issue. Even then they bemoaned that I couldn't change it. Standard corporate IT, etc.
        When I told them I'm the one who writes and implements all client security policy they lit up. So used to being ignored in other companies.
        It turns out Windows install was actually messed up, getting new machine. But my direct, authoritative intervention helped the business.
        Was my first experience of why having policy and implementation as close to the end-user as possible is so important to business flexibility
        (Issue did appear to be a security policy on first look. But I know everything I implement. Anyone but me would have said it was expected.)

        Windows Hello with stereoscopic infrared is seriously impressive. Can optionally require dictated head movements for unlock as well.
        With a BitLocker boot PIN and Windows Hello biometrics you have 3-factor authentication on a Surface Pro 4. This is great.
        Surface 3FA:
        @SwiftOnSecurity The facial depth mapping also has the benefit of making it much harder to beat the bitlocker pin out of you
        I may have been a bit enthusiastic, Windows Hello can be bypassed if you know the Windows password or PIN... So not strict 3FA... But still.

        (whispers to flight attendant): "I don't want to upset anyone, but I think the man in 15C is modeling credit default swaps".

        The big question is how he managed to get more than 3oz of differential equations past airport security.

        In my view, releasing academic "results" without releasing software that can reproduce them is tantamount to fraud.

        It's not that most academic research doesn't work yet, it's that it will never work, and they cover this up by lack of reproducibility.
        Here's how today started. 
        .@collision @SwiftOnSecurity All this is going to do is exacerbate the problem with people not washing their hands.

        .@m0rb Sure. But there is no agency that consumers can report blatant violations of this kind to.
        .@m0rb If you're able to find out the bar's CC processor, then you might be able to notify them. And they might - might - care.
        .@m0rb But other'n that? There is simply no recourse for ordinary consumers.
        .@halifaxunbeard @da_667 Here's the scary part.
        Great.
        So, thinking about the article from earlier today about the 'AI TA' - and @Aelkus' remarks subsequent - we could get a singularityish event.
        Develop an AI that teaches people how to program systems like that.
        Encourage, as part of the teaching, further development in such systems.
        You then get more and more capable systems with better and better teaching methods - quickly.
        Did I say quickly?
