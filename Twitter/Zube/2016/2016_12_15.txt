        "Former Navy SEAL Is Picked by Trump for Interior Secretary." Genuinely surprised, as I thought this post would go to 'raging wildfire'
        Possible cabinet reorganization:
        BREAKING: Obama bans all references to "Santa Claus", parents must now call him  "Ali Husayn ibn Abdullah Ibn Amr al-Shemali"
        TWIST: Hillary Clinton to head ExxonMobil
        The widespread belief that Trump parrots the last person he talks to is going to lead to some farcical musical chairs action at meeting time

        Maybe the worst legacy of the new admin will be the normalization of racism, xenophobia & misogyny that flourished during the campaign.
