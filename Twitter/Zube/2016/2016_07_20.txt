        The #RNCinCLE is like a cable access show from the late '80s. Inspired amateurs seeking nuclear access.
        Obama's "retreat"? He expanded the terror wars to six countries. Expanded surveillance. What does Trump promise -- eight? 12? #RNCinCLE
        Lauding Reagan while denouncing "radical Islam" suggests that remedial history lessons are needed at the #RNCinCLE
        Contemporary right wingers make William F. Buckley look like Noam Chomsky. #RNCinCLE
        Liberals are having fun rightfully mocking #RNCinCLE. Come the DNC, they'll be on their knees, scanning the room for deviation or dissent.

        The date is interesting, as that was around the time I was very active in analyzing the Apple vs. FBI case.
        Usually when a bot tries to compromise my WP, it's "admin" for 10+ tries. This was clearly an individual who knew my name, only tried twice.
        Can anyone find any information about the smaller 131.137.245.0/24 allocation? I can't find anything smaller than DRE-LAN3.
        Well, if Canada's DoD is trying to hack my WordPress, I guess that's a good sign they haven't penetrated my laptop.
        @JZdziarski I have a hard time believing that it was a Canadian agent, as he didn't even apologize. :)
        We're going to build a wall of Tim Hortons, and we're going to make Canada pay for it.

        Reality TV show stars making jokes about email servers. Another tired political convention cliche
        The RNC announcer lady sounds just like the "menu options have changed" phone lady
        Apologies to foreign friends for the cavalcade of crazy they are witnessing right now. My comrades and I are subverting as fast as we can
        Giuliani realizing his lifelong fantasy of endorsing Donald Trump
        Who is the RNC house band? Is it Cleveland's top wedding band or something?
        Republicans rocking out to a song about outdoor fornication
        Melania Trump looking stunning in water wings
        The immigrant who stole Marla Maples' job has a lot of nerve speaking at this event
        True sign of the times: Slovenia has been upgraded to Central Europe. I remember when we were all Eastern European
        DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT JUST PROVIDE AMERICAN FAMILY WITH POTATO. HE WILL PROVIDE *THREE* POTATO
        A childhood spent behind the Iron Curtain prepares people for many hardships, like having to stand up in public and praise Donald Trump
        There's less outrage than I thought about Michelle Obama plagiarizing Melania Trump's convention speech back in 2008
        She stole her words, and then she stole our hearts

        "It is colorful, but is it correct?" - in response to any fancy visualisation of useless data.
        "Correct - relevant - published - pick any two." - Response to academic publications that are clearly designed to bolster publication counts
        "If you need management, you are in the wrong organisation."
        "10: Rock harder. 20: Goto 10."
        "Whoever scores is right." - quote from my Basketball coach when I was 14 on the topic of proper shot technique.

        Reading between the lines can be useful, but so is reading what's on the actual lines.
        Trump campaign now regretting decision to give speechwriting jobs to passed-over VP candidates.
        The "rickroll" line in M. Trump's speech seems almost like a playful signal that the plagiarism was some speechwriter's deliberate sabotage.
        Or it could have been a genuine coincidence. Suspect we'll never know, unless someone fesses up.
        That said, the provenance of her speech is a very inside-baseball thing to be outraged about, given some of the other stuff said last night.

        Last time I saw Rudy Giuliani was at a microcap stock conference lol
        Rudy is yell-ier than he used to be and he used to be pretty shouty.
        I honestly have never heard before night a crowd answer "yes" to "are we crazy?" #RNCinCLE
        Security in Trump VIP box just invited tom cotton to come up, and he said no, @tcberenson reports
        Giuliani is going to bite the head off a chicken, isn't he
        That was the most WWE entrance I have ever seen. Wow.
        this is way better than I would do giving a speech in a different language on a national stage

        Interesting piece on the new antitrust movement. "Democrats Imitate Trust-Busting Teddy in Own Populist Appeal"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-18/democrats-imitate-trust-busting-teddy-in-own-populist-appeal ... 
        Lots of pro-antitrust comments, then a surprising argument from the DOJ antitrust chief, Renata Hesse.
        "We can't punish success," Hesse said. "That would be the worst thing we can do for our economy..."
        "-- to tell people if you get too big we're going to punish you just because you're getting big." This is the person in charge of antitrust.
        Great story on rising interest in antitrust. http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-18/democrats-imitate-trust-busting-teddy-in-own-populist-appeal ... 
        The head of the antitrust division said the biggest economic threat is the gov't forcing structural change to shrink our biggest companies.
        Think about that. That's a remarkable statement. She actually said shrinking big business is 'the worst thing we can do.'
        @matthewstoller Under Jovanovic-Hopenhayn-Melitz model of firm size & productivity heterogeneity, size is an observation on productivity!

        All anonimized of course, just the raw numbers. But if I have to make that myself (aka: implement API's), it's probably too much of a hassle

        Potentially resorting to Google's TPM2 library from ChromeOS because even if it's root only it's actually been used in the real world
        Urgh Intel's new replacement for OpenAttestation still relies on the awful NIARL Java TPM code
        It also builds two copies, one using plain auth and one using SHA1
        The two copies of the code include miscellaneous whitespace differences
        Eventually there will be good enterprise security software. Probably.
