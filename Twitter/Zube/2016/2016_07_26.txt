        Security experts in casual discussion on Twitter were pinning the DNC hack on Russian group long before the latest email leaks. Not partisan
        There's a narrative that "Blame Russia" is manufactured by DNC. No, earlier dumps were dissected by the security community, same conclusion.
        I watched people like @pwnallthethings and others dissect the earlier DNC dump live on Twitter, the media is only picking up on it now.
        I frankly don't care what's in the dumps, only the implications this has for the security industry conveying the reality of online attacks.
        Instead of "AKP emails", Wikileaks dumped private info of ALMOST EVERY WOMAN in Turkey Yes. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeynep-tufekci/wikileaks-erdogan-emails_b_11158792.html ... pic.twitter.com/D6cgHaoFd3
        It was reported widely in Western media as "Erdogan Emails" because Wikileaks claimed that. They weren't. Apparently, nobody checked it.
        Wikileaks doxed all women & all members of political party targeted by a coup in Turkey. All Western media reported was "censorship". Shame.
        The databases dumped endanger practically every woman in Turkey. The emails have no public interest as they're a large Google group.

        Donald Trump threatens to pull the U.S. out of World Trade Organization; calls WTO "a disaster."  http://on.wsj.com/29YrTly  by @WillMauldin
        Trump says he'll pull out of the World Trade Organization. This is a return to a pre-WWII GOP model of politics.http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/07/24/trump-threatens-to-pull-u-s-out-of-world-trade-organization/ ... 
        Post-Civil War to 1928, GOP unified urban workers and industrialists with a promise to keep wages high with protectionism.
        With this strategy, the GOP protected its regional power base (the northeast), its donors (industrial monopolists) and its voters (workers).
        The New Deal reorganized industry. Post WWII, American multinationals began placing production abroad, GOP switched to free trade.
        This accelerated in the 1960s, with a backlash. Wallace, Nixon, and Humphrey fought over textile votes in the Carolinas.
        After a decade of chaos in the 1970s, Reagan/Volcker reorganized the financial system by U.S. deindustrializing of core industries.
        That coalition of U.S. as importer-of-last-resort held in both GOP and Dems until now. Trump is breaking it with his anti-globalist pitch.
        I don't get the shock by economists and foreign policy people at the notion of import substitution as an economic strategy.
        The real underlying structural problem with the economy is that people are mean on the internet.

        71% of voters are angry or somewhat angry about 'the way things are going in this country'. http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/25/trump.clinton.poll.pdf ...

        @a_z_e_t may stay arrested for some months. He asks that people send him crypto and infosec papers so he doesn't get bored
        His address (only plain paper, no books or other things): Aaron Zauner - c/o JVA Moabit - Alt-Moabit 12a - 10559 Berlin - Germany
