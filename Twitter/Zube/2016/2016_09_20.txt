        1/N Some thoughts on @musllibc philosophy and "when there's nothing left to remove".
        2/N So today I spent the afternoon ripping stuff out of my basement preparing to replace and relocate a leaking water heater.
        3/N Much of it was usable but currently broken, and junk compared to what you'd install now if you wanted to use it.
        4/N Stuff like old gas furnaces and all the crap for their exhaust, mazes of water and gas pipes, etc.
        5/N Just like with junk code, realizing you can be rid of it and not have to care if it might still be useful feels good.

        Jaw-dropping inanity & hypocrisy--Wash Post calls for its source @Snowden to be jailed for what Post itself reportedhttp://bit.ly/2db9VBL 
        Ever wonder why the Government lies even when they know they'll get caught? Asymmetry. It's a tax on resistance.pic.twitter.com/kqhKRONY3O
        This documentary--Deep Web, about the Ross Ulbricht/Silk Road prosecution--is excellent
        Must-read by @ggreenwald about WashPost's call for prosecution of @Snowden, WashPost sourcehttps://theintercept.com/2016/09/18/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-after-accepting-pulitzer/ ... 
        This.https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/777590492120879104 ... 
        Just saw Snowden, the movie. It's superb. So happy they did such a great job. Will write more tomorrow.http://bit.ly/2dchFU4

        Pristine example of a journalist concerned that whistleblower leaked too much, not that govt conceals too much. Never ceases to amazehttps://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/777922825201909760 ...

        One of the lies being told about the 215 metadata program is that most of the courts that have ruled on it, ruled in its favor. /1
        The US Federal Court system is not a video game in which you get a point every time a court sides with you. /2
        It is a hierarchy in which higher court rulings invalidate lower ones. The highest court that ruled on this program found it unlawful. /3
        After losing at trial on appeal, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which shut the program down. /4

        I think they still haven't said whether the 27th street device was a real bomb or an inert simulated bomb.
        (Obvious joke about a Samsung phone hooked up to a pressure cooker redacted).
        @mattblaze NYT (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/nyregion/new-york-explosion-chelsea.html ... ) quotes a law enforcement source: "a 'viable device' that failed to detonate."
        Discussion has weirdly shifted from positive and negative impact of @snowden leaks (important questions) to whether he's sufficiently pure.
        Reminds me of "he's no angel" comments when someone of the wrong skin tone gets shot.
        It's unfortunate; there's a legitimate and complex debate to be had over the impact of the leaks, which the "purity" question overshadows.
        For some reason, my first thought was imagining how this conversation would have gone on Twitter. *sigh*https://twitter.com/Wheeler/status/777267241729466368 ... 

        Without a hint of irony, they quickly frame an attack on America's most richly diverse city to justify their attacks on diversity itself.
        ABC reporting both NYC and NJ IEDs used cellphone triggers. If so, that's a rich trail of evidence.https://twitter.com/ABC/status/777595957479350273 ... 

        .@NYPDnews controlled detonation activity is scheduled to occur today, 9/18, from 4:30 PM - 6:30 PM, near Rodman's Neck in The Bronx.
        That answers that. 27th street bomb wasn't just an inert decoy; had explosives.https://twitter.com/Pervaizistan/status/777674143257026561 ... 

        Skeptical of some of this article, but if the part about the cellphone belonging to a family member is true, wow.https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160919/chelsea/thieves-helped-crack-chelsea-bombing-case-sources-say ...

        It's nice when the Dolphins get blown out in the first quarter, as a fan I can get my heart broken early and enjoy the rest of my Sunday.
        The patriots have more points than the Dolphins have yards.
        Writing mean tweets about the Dolphins is way more fun than watching the Dolphins.
        Tom Brady's backup's backup is having a better game than the Miami starting quarterback.
        To be fair to Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill, he is an excellent conversationalist, he loves his family, and he is polite.
        Excited for another Dolphins moral victory!
        @matthewstoller still trying to decide whether their comeback will fall just short as time expires or whether they'll lose in OT.
        @matthewstoller should've gone with c) a running back and the third string rookie QB shred their defense for a 12-play drive
        I can't tell whether I'm more excited for all the Dolphins moral victories or the 6-10 record with hints of promise that will never pan out.

        Journalists covering #Trump and his flood of lies have transformed into invertebrates. #Election2016
        If Trump is elected, U.S. media had better prep their damning op-eds of everyone else's failures early so they can claim moral authority.
        Thanks, Twitter, for making it easy to block people.
        If we put quotation marks around every noun in reference to Trump, it makes those news/media tweets far more honest. #Election2016
        I forgot how vile people can be on Twitter. It's a little scary to see how mediated discussion can turn into a circus.
        If House Intel Committee had done its job of exercising oversight over NSA, there'd have been no Snowden. He did their job for them.
        If you vote Trump as protest don't evade the fact that you're empowering a dangerous erratic narcissist who stokes ethnic tension for power

        I struggle with how to comment on all of these Trump revelations. He's vile. Yet being glib seems dubious. Being literal seems obtuse.

        The language of the new Snowden debate is all about bravery vs. cowardice. Snowden was brave to leak. WaPo cowardly to condemn.
        Or, the other way around: Snowden was cowardly in fleeing to Hong Kong and then Moscow. Ellsberg didn't. &c &c.
        I'm a little lost. What does "bravery" or "cowardice" have to do with the real issue? Abortion clinic bombers are brave.
        Appeals to courage/cowardice are emotional. Everything is a story now. Everything has an arc, & a resolution, or else low Metacritic score.
        Good arguments exist (I probably don't agree) for total clemency for Snowden. None of them are about how brave he was, though, right?
        (Cards=>table: if I got to pick, my best outcome would be conviction and then totally commuted sentence)
        New York could be hit by a comet and Kansas would be like "AMERICA IS BLEEDING" while Bushwick would be like "I guess I walk to work now."
        Words mean things. Snowden's opponents don't get to use this one.pic.twitter.com/YmS1OCOEtn
        Russia and China are _not_ our enemies. The USSR wasn't, either, which is why the Rosenbergs weren't charged with treason.
        "Treason shall consist of associating with countries we don't like" was the specific concern that led framers to Treason clause.
        It's particularly alarming to me to see friends who worked in the US IC repeating the "traitor" claim. You're supposed to know better.
        The National Review, true to form, is not making it easy for reasonable people to articulate how Snowden is a problematic figure.
