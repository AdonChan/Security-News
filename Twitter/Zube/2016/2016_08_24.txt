        Saudi Arabia: bars Jews, forbids women from driving or going out alone, oppresses minorities, funds extremism, receives huge US subsidies
        One thing I did not think when visiting Yemen: "this place would really benefit if my taxes paid for someone to bomb the shit out of it"
        Yemen is Kentucky with Islam. People there love trucks, guns, their country, their traditions, and are not into being bombed by foreigners.
        An excellent way to reduce the threat of Islamic terrorism from Yemen is to avoid killing people's kids, through bombing or starvation
        Imagine our reaction if France was flying armed drones over Kentucky, and giving weapons to Quebec to conduct bombing raids there

        "We're a vote away from either cementing our leadership in the region or handing the keys of the castle to China." What does this mean?
        It's a strange 1970s argument about national competitiveness and trade that has never really made sense.
        Maybe there's strategic rationale for the TPP re: China but I've been paying attention for years and no one's explained it.
        They just keep saying that TPP passes or China wins or something but wins what and why.

        So many minor frustrations with Fi, like: incoming calls might end up via Hangouts (free) or phone (20c/min when roaming)
        Making outbound calls via phone is free when domestic, 20c/min when roaming. Via Hangouts uses tiny amounts of data, so basically free.
        But I need to deliberately choose which app I use rather than something reasonable happening by default, which is adfkljaerasdfaerl;kjasdf
        STOP EXPOSING YOUR IMPLEMENTATION TO ME JUST DO THE RIGHT THING
        (And also seriously how do I get my incoming calls to come over Hangouts when roaming? It seems entirely arbitrary)

        Yes, but assuming they earned trust with some "proof of work". Otherwise auditing their work offsets contribution.https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/767630772765425664 ... 
        ... this requirement thus obviously favors pseudonymous devs over anonymous. Of course exceptions do apply.
        IOW, for an open source project, I think it mostly matters to classify contributors according to their "proof of work" abilities.
