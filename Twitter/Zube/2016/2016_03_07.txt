        Your phone is the closest thing to a brain scan today. If possible, Comey would search your brain for a memory government needs as evidence.
        When we do perfect brain scanning technology, will we be having the same discussion about privacy vs. security? We need to stop this now.
        You wouldn't trust government with the memories from your brain any more than you should trust them with the memories from your iPhone.

        Every phone, computer and SW vendor in the US is looking at the Apple case to decide whether or not strong security is too much trouble.
        Interesting point. https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/705138690272698369 ... 

        @mattblaze If capability to assist was not in controversy, FBI had no case. Apple's mistake was in failing to lock themselves out *properly*
        @mattblaze There are too many services that cannot lock themselves out entirely and also work. We need tech AND law to protect users here.
        Reading about blockchains and thinking it solves everything is the 21st C version of reading Ayn Rand and thinking it explains everything.

        No one is saying the FBI shouldn't be allowed to try to extract data from the San Bernardino phone. (1/2)
        Rather, this is about how much help a manufacturer is required to give the FBI, and ultimately, whether they can sell secure devices.(2/2)
        And speaking of vendors deciding crypto is more trouble than it's worth... Perhaps an amazingly timed coincidence. http://motherboard.vice.com/read/amazon-removes-device-encryption-fire-os-kindle-phones-and-tablets ...

        It would be a whole lot easier for Republicans to fight Trump if Republican voters didn't like Trumps ideas more than Republican ideas
        Trump is on national TV for the last fifteen minutes talking about how offshoring American jobs is bad.
        Trump is pointing out that other countries have much better trains and infrastructure than the U.S.
        Trump: "China has trains that go 300 mph. Our trains go chug-chug-chug. And then they break." 
        Trump talking about our third world trains and laguardia "with the potholes all over the place"
        trump is not wrong about laguardia, tho
        When Dems point out that we might learn from other countries, Dems are unAmerican. Trump just spent 50 minutes saying Chinese trains rule.

        Donald Trump has caused dismay among Democrats and Republicans alike by vowing, if elected president, to wipe all humans from the Earth.
        "I am the planet's saviour," Trump announced today at a rally held in his honour. "Humans are scum and I vow to destroy you all."
        To whoops and cheers Trump continued, "For too long we have been the scourge of this mighty galactic testicle, and I will blow us to dust."

        If you think "complicated math" is a weak point of elliptic curve and a strength of RSA, you might not grok RSA as well as you think.
        If you looked at a diagram of ECC point addition and got confused, don't blame yourself. Those diagrams are confusing and pointless.
        Don't try to grok ECC by understanding lines on graphs. Instead: just cargo-cult addition formula, try to grok abstract algebra.
        Most people who actually code curve software just steal the formulas from things like https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/ .
        The whole concept of point addition is arbitrary; used just to make curve points obey group law, work algebraically, make DH or Schnorr work
        There's just not much INSIGHT you can generate by understanding the line through the point reflecting across the axis &c.
