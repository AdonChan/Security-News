        So it is September already... So who is among those invited to Apple's bug bounty? Or do they violate their NDA telling?

        ... Exploits jsc that was abused before by exploits, then removed from iOS and by accident brought back.

        Student: I'm going to miss Monday's class.
        PSA: I spend enough time dealing with dumb crypto policy ideas proposed by gov't agencies to deal with dumb ideas from random twitter users.
        At least I THINK Monday's a holiday. Now I'm wondering.
        Not to stomp too much on DES's grave. It held up remarkably well for a cipher designed in the 70's, with best attack close to key len.
        People focused on DES's short keys as an NSA plot, but the public design of DES advanced the state of the art in civilian crypto enormously.
        And here were are, in 2016, and the best practical DES attacks still involve exhaustive search hardware. Impressive.
        Interesting that we found more (and worse) attacks against the relatively simple block cipher modes of operation than against DES itself.
