        Disguising malware as a readme file is genius. Nobody ever looks at those.

        According to TV news coverage, when Bernie Sanders gives a speech he's just pantomiming with the intention of commentators talking over it.
        The thing is: most of the racially charged stuff Trump has said, he said before SNL had him host in Nov https://twitter.com/maxboot/status/706609125791141888 ... 
        Weird. http://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-worse-than-getting-shot-by-aaron-burr-not-having-seen-hamilton-1457298388 ... 
        Bernie makes the key point. Institutions govern. It's private government (Wall Street, corporate America) or democratic government.
        Again, not only is Hillary's call for Snyder to resign new, her spox was ridiculing Sanders over it not an hour ago! https://twitter.com/sluggahjells/status/706637572487913472 ... 
        This is essentially a question about the annual $500B+ trade deficit.
        Clinton's clawback of tax credits is an old Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum idea.
        Infrastructure, trade, bailouts, the role of government - this debate is all about big money and democracy.
        "The only multinational trade agreement."
        Hillary has no clue that the "auto bailout" didn't save ONE single job in Flint. We used to have 80,000 GM jobs here. Today? 5,000 jobs left
        .@BernieSanders voted in support of Senate cloture on the auto bailout in December 2008. #DemDebate
        This debate is all about political economy. Big money vs democracy may now be the framework for our politics going forward.
        "I did go, in many places around the world, to sell American products." Wow. Real candor by a former US Secretary of State.
        Hong Kong residential sales plunge 70% as slowdown intensifies http://bloom.bg/1QAzWX  pic.twitter.com/HILcIe5xHx
        Good and long-overdue debate over the economic legacy of the 1990s.
        Q: Many Democratic governors say fracking is safe. Are they wrong?
        Grexit back on the agenda again as Greek economy unravels http://ln.is/www.theguardian.com/nXM29 ... 
        For first time on record in the United States, under-30s are now poorer than retired people. http://gu.com/p/4h734/stw 
        So odd to see all these economists arguing that trade deficits don't really reduce growth. This is an accounting identity.
        And like Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner and everyone else he would have hated doing it.  https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/706905641651216385 ...

        Three reasons why everyone should (consider) using adblocker
        If you downloaded the 'Transmission' app to your Mac last week, YOU NOW ONLY HAVE COUPLE OF HOURS LEFT to check your system for KeRanger.
        KeRanger starts encrypting files 72 hour after installation. Current version targets only local files and won't touch Time Machine backups.

        I think the lesson here to ISPs is: Don't do shady things to "monetize" customer network traffic. The bad PR is far worse than a $1.3M fine.

        .@grempe @dchest Fun idea, but not something I believe would work for normal people. Too complicated, assumes tech users who actually care.

        "Thank you, Mrs Clinton. Now I want to ask you the question I actually asked you and see if you'll answer."
        Come on. Such an easy answer. "Look at me. No cop has ever pulled me over simply because of how I look."
        "The worst thing I've ever been afraid would happen when I got pulled over is that I might get TWO TICKETS".
        Sanders answer on this question is way better. That is a real answer. "I can get a cab". You win this time, Sanders.
        oh lord sanders don't take this too far, you could still win the nomination
        You would achieve none of these police reforms because they are not what municipalities want.

        possible meaningful uses for a liquid nitrogen cooled PC: building Xilinx bitstreams
        EE debugging idea: add asymmetric pullup/pulldowns on GPIO pins, so that you can discern high-Z vs driven low on scope
        (they have to be asymmetric because if you pull it to 0.5Vcc exactly the input buffer becomes very unhappy)
        Brought to you by spending two days on a bug which caused output enable for a pin to not be asserted in specific circumstances
        Alternate low-tech solution: poke it with your finger and see if the waveform wildly thrashes with a 50Hz sine
