        If you are feeling paranoid about password managers, stop using the browser integration and/or online sync. Not the entire password manager.

        How to stop WhatsApp from sharing your number with Facebook:
        The irony here is Apple forced me to change the official AMBER Alert app because it shared your phone number w/NCMEC. WhatsApp got a pass.
        I don't understand why Apple won't let an app share your phone number to report a missing child, but Facebook data mining it is okay.

        Important to note: The NSO exploit chain DID NOT include a sandbox escape. This means their kernel exploits were good enough w/o one.
        Via @citizenlab: an iOS 0day exploit chain used in the wild - ostensibly built by NSO group. Interesting detail. https://deibert.citizenlab.org/2016/08/disarming-a-cyber-mercenary-patching-apple-zero-days/ ... 
        This para stood out. Fact all modern exploits are *chains* of 0day vulns shouldn't be a surprise. This is v normal.pic.twitter.com/07ybR1csCo
        It's a fact 0day policy-wonks consistently get wrong. 0day are merely lego bricks. Exploits are 0day chains. Mitigations make chains longer.

        This bit's really important for IDS. I spend a lot of time on that with my clients.https://twitter.com/da_667/status/769375700340076544 ... 
        And the really tough bit is when an IDS is being added to a pre-existing network.
        I've had many cases where the tap ended up in a suboptimal location because the pertinent switches were fully populated....
        ...and there was no budget for network rework or getting a bigger switch.
        It's a complex problem, and you have to really comprehend your network topology to figure out good placement - much less optimal.
        I -usually- prefer "off the core switch" for most clients; it ends up with the best visibility in many topologies.
        But that varies heavily with some clients, depending on their needs.

        Password managers may have issues that need to be resolved, but for now, a good password manager is far better than the alternatives.

        You know, it's fine to simultaneously say: Yes, everyone should update their iOS. No, you probably haven't been targeted with this attack.

        A simple UI redress vulnerability in @keepersecurity exposes all passwords to websites. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=917 ... 
        Remember, attack surface is not just vulns and exploits. It's all actions (many non-attacker) and all resulting states (many non-technical).

        For a healthy change of pace, @taviso, try finding security flaws in secure messaging applications. It's life-affirming work.

        What password management software really needs is a kind of "safe space", where it can learn and develop comfortablyhttps://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/769378435684675584 ... 
        I use and recommend 1Password (the standalone version, not the weird team thing). Thrilled if Tavis is about to publish vulns in it.
        If those flaws are bananas bad, I'll drop 1Pw and stop recommending it (the flaws won't be in the crypto!). Glad to know more either way.
        Talking other day w students about  phone phreaking; they totally got exploring the network but had no idea free calls was a big deal.
        If you are feeling paranoid about password managers, stop using the browser integration and/or online sync. Not the entire password manager.
        This might be the only smart comment I've seen about password managers today.https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/769561146470924288 ... 
        Also: if you CAN'T use your password manager w/o the browser integration: get a different one.
