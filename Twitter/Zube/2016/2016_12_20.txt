        I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don't let anybody tell you different.
        Beer, of course, is actually a depressant. But poor people will never stop hoping otherwise.
        Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.

Myriachan

        @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking KIDDING ME?? Your POS supporters are telling Muslim and Mexican CHILDREN you're throwing them out!! FUCK U
        If Trump gets impeached in the next four years, I hope that the @nytimes headline will be "Unpresidented!".
        Remember when mobs of gun-toting Tea Partiers flooded DC, pledged to assassinate Obama & burned him in effigy on the mall?

Pinboard

        If you think the tech pledge is ridiculous or a token gesture, consider why so many smart people in your industry disagree.
        Request for security rant: something targeted at activists, journalists, lawyers etc. about why they should use iphones and not android
        Something readable by non-technical mortals that succinctly explains the problems with Android lock screen, hardware, pinging China etc.
        Note that the pledge is techies' first concerted political action since SOPA, and I the first I can remember that is not about a tech issue
        AOL keyword: 2016. 'Sylvester Stallone suggested he was not interested in taking a role as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.'
        @Pinboard Also, quest for mythical "Android flagship" that won't get neglected in a year is kinda like guessing flu vaccine strain in April
        Someone just tweeted to correct me that Trump "never wanted a muslin registry." I can't argue with that
        "The Electoral College Meets Today. Here's What to Expect: Doom"
        @Pinboardhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMSHvgaUWc8 ... 
        I don't even recognize my own friends anymore! RT @kzwa: @Pinboard i'd be on board for this. It's pretty hard to find decent muslin

        Arguably links to academic journals are a little more significant than "bookmarks"; this breaks both scholarly and WWW best practices.https://twitter.com/SAGE_News/status/810827566294728705 ... 
        That's just the problem, one person's "bookmark" is another's "link to a scholarly journal". But we've had permalink technology for years
        Pinboard revenue from 12/1-12/21 goes to the National Immigration Law Center. Raised so far: $9,384. Donate with me!https://nilc.z2systems.com/np/clients/nilc/donation.jsp?campaign=15 ... 
        Musicians turn down huge sums, refusing to play inaugural; some reporters are won over by cold cuts & bags of Lays.https://twitter.com/mikeallen/status/810675331396931584 ... 
        Most surprising thing I learned at yesterday's tech solidarity meeting in NY: for many organizations, what's needed is *more* tracking tools
        Other surprising thing: key management (though they don't use the term) is a huge issue for non-profits. Spreadsheets full of passwords
        Suggest replacing "use Tor" with "here's a way to not keep all your passwords in an Excel spreadsheet run by an intern" as standard advice
        @Pinboard This reminds me of the webcam pointed at a collection of RSA tokens so the staff can share login credentials.
        One outcome I'm really hoping for from TS events is better security advice, and matchmaking between infosec volunteers and vulnerable orgs

RegexTip

        Ripgrephttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep ... 
        Python requires you to import the 're' module to take advantage of the built-in regular expression library.
        The -l option to grep lists only names of files matching a regex. The upper case alternative -L lists files NOT containing the regex.

        .@ppetrovdotnet perhaps but that problem is solved by hr processes that are pretty established at most places.
        .@ppetrovdotnet I'm really talking about getting in front of  problem. Where someone wants to do the right thing but can't find what that is
        .@ppetrovdotnet so they do what they think is ok but puts the company at risk in doing so

        I still think @apple should allow devices registered in the dev portal to be downgradable to all previous iOS versions.
        By limiting downgrades to developer's devices Apple would ensure that general population is still on latest iOS while tweakers are happy.
        Possibility to downgrade iOS devices would also decrease incentive to drop 0-day to release jailbreak for latest version.

        No, people drawing (obviously) superficial comparisons with events from more than a century ago are not "spreading conspiracy theories".
        Similarly, it is not terribly helpful to point out that the title of a Russian ambassador is not literally "archduke".
        Problem with the "archduke" comparison is that the likely effect of this is in the opposite direction of that one. And pretty obviously so.

        5. Few said 'we need to understand rural Americans being killed with meth'. But oxy --> that's not a moral but a health problem...
        6. In fact the oxy epidemic is full of the most sociopathic criminals, only they wear suits and have lobbyists.
        7. And as West Virginia got hooked by PBMs and big pharma, the W. Virginia gov't actually tried to act. The Feds? Not so much.
        8. This is why the Federal Trade Commission exists. It's why the Department of Justice exists. To protect Americans.
        9. But they did not. And so many Americans died. And their family members are angry. Rightfully so. Do they know who to be angry at?
        10. Maybe. Maybe not. But in this system, where no one pulled the trigger and no one enforced the law, who should be the object of rage?
        11. Libertarian grifters like @JDVance1 step in and say 'culture culture culture' instead of Purdue Pharmaceuticals.
        12. "The unfettered shipments amount to 433 pain pills for every man, woman and child in West Virginia." <--- That's not culture.
        13. But then lots of people, including people in both parties and in the media, believe it's culture culture culture.
        14. People are dying. White people, rural people, dying. Some are racists. Some aren't. But they didn't ship the pills.
        15. They didn't prescribe the meds. They don't own the stock. They aren't getting the bonuses. They didn't do this to their communities.
        16. They are angry. Because the people in fancy suits did do it. And about that, they aren't wrong. Those who say otherwise are wrong.
        17. Maybe they are blaming the right people in fancy suits. Or maybe they aren't seeing that one set of fancy suits aren't quite as bad.
        18. This is why saying pretending that there is such a thing as an 'economic issue' is so foolish.
        19. Because this involves corporations somehow it becomes an 'economic issue' and therefore not about people but numbers and redistribution.
        20. This is a question of commercial and political freedom. Until we have political leaders seeing problems this way, the anger will grow.
        21. Our democratic institutions are supposed to protect us from harm, not addict us to pills. So if that's what they do, what good are they?
        22. And the Oxy billionaire Sackler family is taking their political instability creating addiction machine global.http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/#nt=oft12aH-1gp2 ... 
        23. Now THIS is a national security problem. This crushes communities and foments sectarianism. This needs to be reckoned with. Ok I'm done.

        Zone transfer monitoring implemented for @dnsspy, I call this a productive evening. 
        Letting it run in "alpha"-mode for a few days before I give the beta testers access.
        This "let's quickly make an app that monitors DNS" turned in to a bigger challenge than I had anticipated. Lots of cases to keep in mind.
        Also: not everyone follows the RFCs, so I need to be pretty liberal in how I validate DNS records.
        But it's getting there, for a first launch I think it's 80% done now. Polishing the current code a bit and it should be good to go.
