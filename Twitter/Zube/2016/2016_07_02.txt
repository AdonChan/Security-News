+         I remember learning economics when I was 19 and being so proud of myself
+ . And there were actually student protesters against the econ class.
+         I remember looking down on those protesters. They were so unserious and
+ their silly moral arguments had no accompanying charts
+         It's just so easy to fall for this if you have no perspective on the wor
+ ld (as I didn't.) Much harder to get out of it.
+         First, you need soul-searching to figure out how you could have thought
+ and acted so callously. Then unlearn BS. Then, learn reality.
+         I did better in economics than in any other subject. Those As made me pr
+ oud. It was just a big ego trap.
+         So many professionals want to keep getting As, no matter what. Climb tha
+ t ladder even as you pose as open-minded. Climb climb climb!
+         But there are no As for realizing you've thought and believed as moral m

+         Yes, the anti-recording-indicator that Apple filed a patent for is reaso
+ nably worrisome and potentially stifling of legitimate uses.
+         However, such a system would be -very- -stupid- for Apple to incorporate
+  into their products.
+         First, it's trivially defeatable. A couple layers of saran wrap will blo
+ ck enough IR to make the whole issue moot.
+         Second, third parties are capable of, and will, clone the "anti-recordin
+ g" signal, so that anti-recording harassment becomes commonplace.
+         Which would be a pretty nasty UX failure on Apple's part, and open them
+ to all manner of legal issues.
+         Third, definitionally, if Apple has patented it, that means everyone wit
+ h a non-Apple phone will be immune to it.
+         And last I checked, that group outnumbers the Apple group by a pretty fa
+ ir margin.
+         (And that's just in smartphones; we're not even addressing the massive q
