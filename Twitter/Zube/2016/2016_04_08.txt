        Tech details on the FBI's Tor exploit seem essential for certain defenses. See, e.g., https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/rsearch.pdf ... https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/717465105588482049 ... 
        If the defense believes the exploit exceeded the warrant, for example, no way to challenge that without tech details.
        So now that this is an actual criminal case, the FBI's Tor browser exploit isn't just about vul disclosure equities, it's about fair trials.
