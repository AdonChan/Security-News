        so there looks like no possible way to dump this data directly into the final db schema state. tables sizes too big, locks writers up
        that's a real bummer, have to use an intermediary dump then import to final schema :/.
        so... rethinkdb or cassandra for intermediary dumps...
        or, stick with pgsql, and drop all indexes and not worry about duplicated data.

        Frequent flyer miles are like a weird company-store like monetary system where airlines are the issuer.
        Frequent flyer programs get airline management focused on pricing games and financialization rather than running a good airline.

        If we do our job right, we're changing our job every 2 years.
        We don't fear being replaced by automation, we embrace it.

        Canadian immigration: very polite, but the strictest questioning I've had anywhere
        Automated announcement just listed a bunch of cities in alphabetical order, then followed Zurich with San Juan

        Conference organisers: figure out what your plan for dealing with this sort of situation is in advancehttps://twitter.com/nd_kane/status/767638838336446464 ... 

        Don't put the work of figuring out what you should do on those affected. Don't just ignore the issue. Don't let sponsorship affect you.
        Hearing about this kind of situation and the conference response is a major influence on which conferences I'll attend or present at.
        This presentation brought up vm introspection, then entirely ignored ROP attacks
        Presenting security features without describing the set of attacks they actually protect against really should not be a thing
        He also implied that SMAP protects userspace from the kernel, which is an...  interesting perspective

        SNI support went into #OpenBSD's libtls a few minutes ago. Should work in httpd now. Go forth and test!
        Company pitches story, reporter asks tough, detailed questions. After interview, PR for company calls, says they regret pitching story.
        I guess it's my turn for a Twitter rant.
        Capitalism, whatever you might think of it's alternatives, is a system which quantifies human life in dollar amounts.
        A prudent company will weigh the cost of cleaning a toxic waste spill against the cost of legal settlements from the cancer deaths 3/?
        In infosec, CISO's and such are trained to weigh the cost of mitigations against the cost of a breach. 4/?
        It would be great if every frontline customer support rep would be educated enough to spot phishing attempts
        but the reality of it is skilled labour is expensive and CSR's make minimum wage (I used to be one.) 6/?
        The cost of training and evaluating a workforce is much, much more than the cost of a breach, which is asymptotically $0.
        So what can we do? When a company is breached, we all wring our hands about the company ("Target got breached, sucks for Target") 8/?
        But only a little bit of talk about the real victims which in most cases are the customers themseveles.
        Perhaps we as an industry need to promote fewer stories of X got breached and more stories about the pensioner who was robbed 10/?
        i dont get it. are we too lazy or not lazy enoughpic.twitter.com/U93cIKhCYW
        It's cool that now that you vape you don't smell like cigarette smoke but can you do something about smelling like mango vomit?
        never hits the news, not much of a thought is given of the real victims more than just immediately post-breach 12/
        So the investing thing about firewall dump... Apparently no exploits for Juniper, only implants. Maybe had back doors, no need for sploit.
        Which throws further suspicion on NSA as responsible for the Juniper back doors already discovered...
        Whoever had '2 weeks' down as the bet for how long it would take to shell the office coffee machine, claim your $$.pic.twitter.com/AIwDTXsv7W
        No, @WSJ - paying a ransom is NOT an 'investment'.
        Casting the payment of criminals as an investment is irresponsible, unethical, and gorram -stupid-.
