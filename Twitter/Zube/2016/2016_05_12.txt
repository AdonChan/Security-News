        Trump is the yawning gap between the proud propaganda self-image of America & the cruel, corrupt, stupid truth. A confrontation with reality
        Trump is disease for which there is no cure. A late stage cancer. A tumor that not only resists the chemo & the radiation but thrives on it.
        Pilot just pronounced the "s" in Illinois. Lord, I'm not a praying man but..."
        "But Bernie has a better chance to beat Trump!" Maybe, but the Dems would rather lose with Hillary than give the nomination to Sanders.

        Things are so much better by default in the PC ecosystem now. You used to have to manually turn on BIOS firmware signature verification!
        You noobs want to hear something crazy? You used to be able to edit BIOS firmware files to apply your own bootup image. No signing.
        People literally used to object that firmware signing took away their freedom. Yes, the freedom for anything to just reflash your BIOS.
        Kids will never believe that people used to run code not approved by their device manufacturer. Crazy.

        Today I learned how to tell if a certificate is Extended Validation. Have to check the Certificate Policy Identifier https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate#Extended_Validation_certificate_identification ... 
        In this case, the malware was code signed, but not with an EV certificate. Microsoft SmartScreen only instantly trusts EV signed binaries.
        Win8+, Microsoft SmartScreen is a code reputation system that prompts users before running unknown code, can also stop non-admins completely
        Vendors like Digicert will only issue code-signing EV certs locked inside a USB hardware dongle, unless you have proof of an HSM.
        However, other vendors will issue EV code signing certificates as just simple files, so it varies. I only have experience with two vendors.
        Two SmartScreens:
        There's probably no technical limitation on signing code with a certificate with emojis in the name.

        Such frustration with ineffective security vendor emails has led to creation of a google form to ask them questions about their product.
        Even the vendor emails I did decide to read lacked basic information about what the security product actually does.

        The fact that @google would almost certainly be unhappy about this aside, this is a terrible disguise. It just calls MORE attention to it.

        Also, as much as I'd love to investigate this, I (literally) want the root canal that I'm in the process of getting more.
        More disturbing than the possibility of police impersonating Google is the possibility of nutcase with LPR impersonating police AND Google.

        https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165 ...  and the CLA really do leave me feeling conflicted about Signal
        I have sympathy for wanting to run a centralised service. I even understand the desire to use Google services.
        It's much easier to move between services now than it was historically. But many of my friends use Signal, so there's still effective lockin
        Having no ability to modify the client and still communicate with my friends limits the practical usefulness of the freedoms I'm given
        ... and I don't think forcing users to choose between using Google services or not being able to securely reach their friends is a net benefit

        @taviso These also affect Norton, Symantec Endpoint (All Platforms), SMSME, SSE, and probably all other Symantec & Norton branded products.

        Poutine would taste better with almost any other potato prep. And there is no worse corruption of fries; every french fry dish is better.

        It was a great year for Black Hat USA crypto submissions. In particular, these three:
        David Adrian is speaking at BH USA on TLS export crypto and DROWN, the coolest TLS attack yet discovered.
        Sean Devlin and Hanno Bock are presenting new research on practical GCM attacks against TLS. This talk will be amazing.
        And JP Aumasson and Luis Merino are doing a deep dive on Intel SGX.
