+         The whole Harold Martin / NSA indictment was just to troll us, right?

+         Somewhere, a PR flack has been trying to convincingly remind reporters t
+ hat the vast majority of Samsung products do not explode.
+         Here is why email scan order went only to Yahoo
+         More on Yahoo, via @charlie_savage. Biggest mystery to me is still why t
+ hey would not involve the security group.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/techn
+ ology/yahoo-email-tech-companies-government-investigations.html ...
+         If Yahoo didn't think this had security implications worth mentioning to
+  the sec group, the company was run by incompetent nitwits.
+         OTOH, if they didn't involve the security group for some other reason, i
+ t may have been run by malicious nitwits instead.
+         Disclaimer: I've never worked at Yahoo, but I have worked a big company
+ run by nitwits, which later became a small company run by nitwits.

+  Inherently difficult line between classified and public for him.
+         I've had students with clearances. I always tell them (but don't even ha

+         Weird that Martin didn't scramble to get rid of classified stuff in his

+         If police raided the homes of half my friends, they'd find troves of ele

+         @passingthehash @anton_chuvakin IMHO goal oriented part is key. RT isn't
+  finding every vul instead it's trying to show nightmares scenarios
+         .@anton_chuvakin I believe that red teaming is about demonstrating effec
+ t far more than it is about finding vulns...
+         .@anton_chuvakin usually pentests have bounds and more about finding vul

+         .@anton_chuvakin that's part of it definitely.
