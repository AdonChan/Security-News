        For Tor to make such a significant change to personnel, it's likely there's also some evidence the public doesn't need to see.

        2000! RT @timoreilly: Get in the habit of voting even if you think it doesn't matter. One day you'll discover that it did matter, too late
        The platitude that any individual vote matters is one of the biggest pieces of intellectual dishonesty from otherwise reasonable people
        Any election that is actually swung by your vote, or the vote of you and your fifty closest friends, will in reality be decided by lawyers
        Your vote does not matter, and will never matter. But vote anyway, because often there is a free snack or sticker of some kind
        .@baconmeteor likewise, making this point is one of those faux-intellectual things that sounds smart but is actually dumb as shit
        You can't call me a nihilist when I JUST SAID you get a snack or sticker
        @baconmeteor Some of the others that go with it also don't make a lot of sense ("if you don't vote, the outcome is your fault" - how now?)
        If you want a meaningful political voice in our flawed democracy, don't lie to yourself about voting. Get out there and post to Facebook!
        45% of my becoming a naturalized American citizen was because the VFW women's auxilliary baked brownies for our court ceremony
        Another reason not to vote: because the options are Cristina Kirchner vs. a Venom-like sentient hairpiece
        If only there were a blood test for political preference! RT @WoodLloydWood: that's also why you give blood. which matters more.
        You can vote while knowing it's pointless, just like you can be a morally upright atheist. Just be honest about it, is all I'm saying
        Please ignore my voice about your vote in the Presidential election not mattering if you are on the Supreme Court. You REALLY need to vote
        Last time I voted, I got a sticker that said YA VOTE, which is Spanish for "hit me if you're a Trump supporter"
        What I'm learning is that there's a LOT of disparity in snack and sticker distribution by polling place. Time for a @mattyglesias explainer!
        I didn't come to this country to vote. I came here to take your jobs (which I perform lazily) and seduce your women with my Slavic nihilism
        Wishful thinking is not the opposite of cynicism. They share a duplex.

        There are bits in this article I agree on, and bits I disagree on - but either way it is a useful read: http://blog.brokep.com/2016/06/08/community-2-0/ ... 
        One important topic this article touches on is the harmfulness of hero-worship.
        It is harmful to everybody: To the person doing it, to the person being worshipped, and to the community at large.
        (This is of course nowhere near to the core of the article, but it is an aspect I wish to highlight)
        It is important to keep in mind that everybody in (in)security puts their pants on one leg at a time. And just because someone has been ...
        ... "right" a few times doesn't mean he will be "right" the next time.
        I can't count the number of times I've been disastrously wrong on topics of security. It's called learning, and everybody is doing it.

        The secondary (wifi, cellular bases, etc) geolocation technologies just got a LOT more important in the SW today. http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/GPS-Interference-NOTAM-For-Southwest-226365-1.html ... 
        GPS signals are BELOW the visible noise floor (you can't see on a spec analyzer); takes very little energy at ground level to disrupt them.
        FTR, I've done things in my career that probably displeased intelligence agencies. AFAICT, I've never been the target of any "operations".
        Maybe some agencies have tried to compromise some computer I use or something. But poison-tipped umbrellas and seduction? Not so far.
        That said, forget I said any of this should bodies be found buried in my yard.
        If you're response is to say that this is because I'm no big deal, I agree.

        But while we continue valuing behaviour that encourages and disguises abusers, they're going to keep hurting those we know and care about
        This isn't just about making it easier to report people. Many of our communities explicitly reward abusive behaviour patterns
        Just as people can hide sexual abuse behind charisma, we've made it possible for people to hide verbal abuse as "robust criticism"
        We need communities where having power is not a ticket to be able to abuse without consequences, no matter the nature of the abuse
        Setting a good example here doesn't just help us, it helps people we've never met and will never know. They matter just as much.
        Oh cool it might be possible to add arbitrary lights belonging to other people to your account
        Yeah looks like it's basically possible for me authorise my phone to access every single one of these bulbs
        Need to sort out the AES parameters to make sure of this but huh gosh this is really pretty bad
        So here's a fun thing: the lightbulbs speak AT commands
        Weirdly, it's running on the same port as the Limitless LED bridge API
        Oh god it's basically a Limitless LED bridge built directly into a bulb, isn't it
        Fuck I'm deep enough into this rabbit hole that I'm recognising technology borrowed from other vendors
        Ha ha whoops someone else found this stuff last year:https://blog.viktorstanchev.com/2015/12/20/the-many-attacks-on-zengge-wifi-lightbulbs/ ... 
        Welp good to know that it's definitely still just as broken
        Oh ffs it's another of those terrible RGBW bulbs that's actually RGB/W because turning on white turns off RGB
        Ok confirmed I can add a bulb even when there's nothing linking me to the bulb other than that I know the MAC address
        Finding every bulb would really not take that long
