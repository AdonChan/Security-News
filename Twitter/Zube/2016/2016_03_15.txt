        I'm as amused by NYPost's "Master key of terror" story as anyone, but the lock-pedant in me is compelled to point out it's not a master key.
        The NYC 1620 fire key locks are all keyed alike to a single key; it's not a master key, dammit! </rant>.
        Also, there are about 25 standard elevator fire keys in use in the US. The worst you can do is recall an elevator to the lobby.
        If you consider having an elevator go to the lobby an act of terror, you must spend a lot of time being terrified.
        The 1620 key is even less powerful as an elevator terror tool than that toddler who pushes the buttons for every floor.
        If you want a terrifying firefighting tool that anyone can buy, go for a Halligan tool or an axe, not a 1620 key.
        I have a feeling that it won't take long into the Trump administration before crypto policy is the least of our problems.

        You want an absolutist view? Even the NSA cannot crack a properly used, randomly generated one time pad. Chew on that.
        And it can be generated and applied using any number of innocuous household objects.
        So if the DOJ gets too troublesome, I'm sure someone will figure out a means to generate and distribute one-time-pads at scale.
        Only reason we haven't gone with that is that it's much more painful than every other means of encryption.

        In a chiefly political move, I have decided to reject the existence of politics.
        Posted a question in a technical forum, forgetting that technical forums are only there to pick holes in your question, not answer it.
        Me: "What is 2+2?"
        Me: "WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION YOU PEDANTIC NECKBEARD TWATS?"
        Things to put on my headstone: "Fucking hell"; "I was cremated so fuck off"; "Wish you were here".
        Things to put on my headstone: "Fuck off you morbid cunt"; "TBA"; "Your mum".
        Technical forum update: the forum has answered the question they wanted to answer rather than the question I asked. Situation normal.
        Technical forum update: two of the forum members are now disagreeing over the semantics of their incorrect interpretations of my question.
        Technical forum update: I have abandoned the technical forum in favour of asking a nearby duck.
        I'm eating a sausage roll that I believe Mary Berry would call "a fucking shit-arsed wank of a bake".
        "What cunt," I think she'd say, "thought this flaccid cock of a sausage roll was okay to sell? I wouldn't fucking sell this to Hitler."
        Enraged by Top Gear's Cenotaph stunt, Tip Guar's Jeremy Clarkson takes the new Volkswagen Fascist for a spin round Auschwitz.
        Technical forum update: I wish I hadn't bothered.
        I think that sausage roll I criticised earlier has extracted its revenge in my colon.

        Did you make sure you know where to vote on Tues? Did you put a note in your calendar, including the place to go? Alvarez is LEADING POLLS.

        REMINDER: You can register to vote at your polling place on Election Day. #NoExcuses https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/709145032968679424 ... 
        You don't have to be a pierced hipster to want Alvarez out. She's a ludicrous incompetent, kept in office by machine politics.

        Alvarez was polling 34-27 over Kim Foxx back in Feb. If you want Alvarez out, you have to go vote Foxx tomorrow.
