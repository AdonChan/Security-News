        Q (by me): You can build more complicated intrusion detection algorithms, but why?  A: To get tenure - https://www.wired.com/2016/07/clever-tool-shields-car-hacks-watching-internal-clocks/ ...  #AcademicLife
        Not just that, also all the CAN tools being presented, research is supposed to solve a problem.  There are lots of problems in car hacking.
        Attacks bypassing IDS and lack of CAN bus tools are not problems we currently face.  Focus on actual problems we face.
        How to examine firmware of ECU, how to find bugs in that firmware, how to debug exploits in ECUs, how to bypass safety protections in ECUs
        ...and lots of other open issues.  That last topic is the topic that @nudehaberdasher and I will be presenting at @BlackHatUSA this year.
        To @0xcharlie's point, Vehicle Spy/CANoe/etc have the tools nailed down. We should work on breaking (i.e. improving) auto tech & firmware RE
        If an IDS with one simple rule stops all known CAN injection attacks,I think we need to spend more time thinking up new attacks than new IDS

        After a brief chat, the Queen will behead David Cameron and eat him. He will be the twelfth prime minister Her Majesty has consumed.
        Meanwhile the new prime minister, Tess May, will "kiss hands" with the Queen. This is Her Majesty's first chance to taste her next victim.

        @thegrugq @matthew_d_green @Bugcrowd Essentially it's no bounty, but just a message: "we won't sue you"
        Is there already a union like organization trying to lobby for fair wages for bug bounty submitters?
        Big companies are cautious about doing bug bounties. They start gently. When they see huge backlash, it scares them (and others) away.
        For researchers expecting to get paid for their skills, a "testing the waters" bug bounty looks insulting (it is); so they lash out.
        Some companies also start bug bounties to avoid negative press about security vulnerabilities. When the payouts don't stop the bad press... 
        Bug bounties are at least a good start to stop the feeling of entitlement on the vendor side(& their customers) to get auditresults for free
        "Don't ask for a raise. If your employer is not mature enough you might get fired."
        . @melsecurity i was just rewriting the argument that people asking for higher bug bounties scares companies away from offering bounties.
        I still remember my http://PHP.net  password from 10 years ago. Seems it doesn't work anymore 
        The point here is that freelancers are usually more expensive than FTE because they carry risk themselves. Bug bounties turns this around.
        Narf! sound you make when you did not submit to BHEU cause abstract of talk at a different con sounded too similar and then see actual talk.
        So yeah I wish more talks would actually contain what their abstract promised...
        I "love" @swissotel email support: Question: can i use xyz reward to get a discount for a stay between A and B in room type X. Answer: yes.
        I was just asked by Apple how i want to be credited for a kernel driver bug I submitted: release of 10.11.6 imminent?
        Apparently people believe being credited by Apple for security means payment. That is about the opposite of reality.
        Yes there is no formal contract with bug bounty programs. still inviting people to audit you for bounty payments is equivalent to hiring.
        I wonder if all the consultants talking down on bug bounty programs do this because they fear to get paid only for success in future.
        To everyone who makes a living submitting to bug bounties. Why don't you get a real job? - some angry consultant
        Bug bounties are there to pay people for catching bugs left over after release. This has nothing todo with work done before release.

        It is, of course, much cheaper to only produce one kind of battery - saves millions on logistics, supply chain, etc.
        And it makes 'upgrading' (hence: getting money from the buyer in the future) much easier if you only have to ship a patch.
        This is nothing new in the tech world, if you've ever used a device from Brocade, Sun, Oracle, IBM, Cisco...just off the top of my head.

        So many people (and companies) focused on zero days while ignoring 5,437 days.
        I will post evidence from the actual WhatsApp reversed binaries soon. They have code blocking encrypted calls to anyone with a SA number.

        We sent an announcement (if you follow me here you already knew about it) about Jailbreak to our mailing list. Google red-flagged it.
        So like in the future if Google tells you Starfighter is trying to steal your credentials or whatever, that's why.
        Guess: we included a link to sign up to the unofficial Starfighter Slack (which is a Google form), and I'm guessing Gmail hates those.
