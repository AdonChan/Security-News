        The burglars timed the break-in to coincide with the broadcast of the fight, in the hopes that guards, etc would be preoccupied listening.
        Anyway, if you've not read @BettyMedsger's The Burglary or seen @1971film, you should.
        Yes, government conspiracies and spy honeytraps happen. But if it's your go-to explanation for things, you probably need a reality check.

        The guy across from me on the train appears to be trying to convince his seatmate to invest in a ponzi scheme.
        I think I'm actually watching a long con unfold in real time.  Fascinating.
        Hmm, less sure that this is a ponzi scheme and not just a sleazy investment guy soliciting business. Jury still out.
        Meanwhile, I'm glad I'm not the poor seatmate being subjected to this. At least he sounds like he's not biting at this point.
        Those referring to him today as "Cassius Clay" aren't casual jerks. They're going OUT OF THEIR WAY to be jerks.
        Trump says Muslims and Hispanics aren't suitable to serve as judges in his cases. Will they be allowed to serve as Secret Service agents?
        In a hotel with elevators where you select destination floor & are assigned car. Optimizes elevator movement at the expense of all else.
        This is would be an optimal design if it weren't for, you know, elevator passengers.
        This might make sense in an office high-rise, where most are regular users. But in a hotel, it's a UI & UX disaster.

        I always get Louis Tomlinson and Ricky Tomlinson mixed up.
        I think the thing to remember is that Johnson, Gove, Cameron and Osborne are all cunts and you should decide for yourself which way to vote.
        The last thing Bojob or Gove or Farage, or Dave or Osborne want is for us to make an informed decision. They want us to make their decision.
        So make your own decision. Register to vote: https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote ...  and make the referendum result representative of the country.
