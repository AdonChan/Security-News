        Which is bigger: the DNC emails or Tim Kaine?
        Just watched a very weird Dick Cavett show from early 1970. First, it's  Dean Jones and Madeline Kahn. Very theatrical and funny.
        Then they leave and are replaced with Muhammad Ali and Norman Mailer.  Totally different vibe.
        Mailer comes on and tries to connect with Ali, which is hit and miss. Judging by his speech, it appears that Mailer was fucked up.
        And poor Dick Cavett, having to play traffic cop. Hey, I'll take it over today's late night games and karaoke.pic.twitter.com/RHMso54f9D

        I respect Snowden a lot and think his gizmo is great for research, but if you're serious about threats on iOS, use a Faraday bag when down.

        Let me put it this way; if you're serious about mobile tracking threats, you use a Faraday bag and bring a notepad. Compromise bad.

        I wish people who love each other would say to each other, when they fight, "Please-a little less love, and a little more common decency."
        Say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile!
        Wars would be a lot better if guys would say to themselves sometimes "Jesus, I'm not going to do that to the enemy. That's too much."

        So now we're going to have to deal with a wave of beat sweetener puff pieces. Hooray!
        I've seen @timkaine for years at Halifax Conf where he's shown he has a) sense of humor, b) serious interest in foreign affairs. 2 assets.
        Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.
        3/ The Kaine pick definitely tells me they don't think the growth opportunity is on the left. @petraubetcha @jeneps
        Tim Kaine pick is like your sister announcing her destination wedding is going to be in San Antonio.
        Let the far left complain: Hillary and Kaine can win: http://thebea.st/2a0jVhv pic.twitter.com/MaojPQ2ypb

        Clinton probably picked Kaine because the two of them see the world the same way. She tends to think about governing and policy first.
        Praising Kaine
        My guess is that Clinton picked Kaine because she thinks he would be a good President. #ControversialOpinion

        When a site asks me to use an adblocker with everyone else but them, it's like they're asking me to use a condom with everyone else but them
        Your know that thing about not perpetuating the parts of your industry you want to stop? Don't go to RSA; don't go to DEFCON
        I'm also saddened that we have allowed a single site to be the regulator of our inclusion in society, family, and friends.
        Never trust someone who says they're the only person who can keep you safe. Not in your personal life, not in business, not in politics.
