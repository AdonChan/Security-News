        I wonder how much Big Emacs paid Apple to get rid of the escape key. They'll stop at nothing in their war on vi.
        MacBook Pro has a secure enclave where you can go and cry
        I still want a real escape key.
        Developers will love this you say? DEVELOPERS WANT A DAMN ESCAPE KEY.

        Useful question here....https://twitter.com/mims/status/791349461180096512 ... 
        Bernie Sanders is trying to single handedly kill AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warnerhttp://cnb.cx/2eN2LSG 
        .@mcuban: "The entire app-based content industry is at the mercy of those two companies." So why not antitrust?http://www.recode.net/2016/10/25/13404854/mark-cuban-time-warner-at-t ... 
        Exactly. This concentration should never have been allowed.https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/790315670588096512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ... 
        Proponents of the Time Warner-ATT merger are basically arguing for a slightly larger and more stable oligarchy.
        Ie. Facebook/Google/Amazon are anti-competitive dictators that destroy markets, so why can't AT&T compete with them by buying Time Warner?
        Face/Google/Amazon did these anti-competitive acquisitions that never should have been allowed, so why can't AT&T do one too?
        Either we live in a democracy and open up our commons to free speech, free commerce, and markets, or we don't. That's the issue.
        Concentrating power for forty years has destabilized our politics. Really want to keep going down that road and see where it ends?
        Blocking a merger isn't 'punishing'. And opposition to *ALL* concentration in this space isn't singling out.https://twitter.com/nathansnewman/status/791628007043633152 ... 
        No, false. Google is absolutely the result of many many mergers (1 per week on avg). See Youtube, Doubleclick, etc.https://twitter.com/nathansnewman/status/791630479057362944 ...

        I'm vey interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said " I know we have an Erica Garner problem" in the #PodestaEmails19
