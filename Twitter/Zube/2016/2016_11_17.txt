        "Controversial" is the hardest-working word in American politics right now
        Empty Chair would be a better pick for most cabinet positions than the names being talked about right now
        Empty Chair 2020!
        Empty Chair enjoys massive bipartisan support, and did well in the debate against Clint Eastwood in 2012
        @baconmeteor Sede Vacante has centuries of experience in administration!
        Where's the mash-up of "Yakety Sax" and the "Horst Wessel Lied" when you need one?https://twitter.com/awprokop/status/798708532493381633 ... 
        "Firings Leave Trump Transition in Disarray" says headline. It's like, Day 6. The guy hasn't even watched the HR video yet, or gotten his PC
        Serious question: does the President get a briefing on Federal standards for sexual harrassment in the workplace?
        Ben Carson, who ran for president, turns down Health and Human Services because he doesn't have enough experience:http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/ben-carson-declines-cabinet-position-donald-trump/index.html ... 
        @baconmeteor I think he stumbled on the "Human" Services bit
        Right now fear of opposing Trump is mostly irrational. Once he has staffed every agency with Priebuses and Bannons it won't be.
        Horribly tendentious map visualization from the NYT makes the candidate who won more votes look like a tiny minorityhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/16/us/politics/the-two-americas-of-2016.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=g-artboard%20g-artboard-v3%20&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news ... 
        It doesn't really matter who hundreds of thousands of acres of empty Wyoming wilderness voted for, and the NYT knows that
        Trump: "Why are you hitting yourself?" Media: 6,000 word think piece "Why *are* we hitting ourselves?"
        One thing younger Americans may not realize is that it used to be rare to refer to the President as "Commander in Chief". Changed after 9/11
        It also used to be unheard of, and would be very alarming, to hear chants of "USA" at a political convention. Strictly for sporting events
        @baconmeteor it was common in WWIIhttp://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=Commander%20in%20Chief.Commander%20in%20Chief ... 
        @baconmeteor Hillary won the vast majority of votes in NYC, but this farm voted overwhelmingly for trump.

        "If a left-leaning Nobel laureate economist has trouble escaping from the confines of Econ 101, what hope for the less sophisticated mind?"
        This elitism is ridiculous. "Sophisticated" is code for "credentialed. The problems have been obvious to normal people for years.
        In a not-unrelated development, it turns out economist scholars at top universities shill for monopolies.https://www.propublica.org/article/these-professors-make-more-than-thousand-bucks-hour-peddling-mega-mergers ... 
        What hope for the unsophisticated mind? Turns out, most people actually notice the shitty things that economists write out of their models.
        Left-leaning economists do not include in their models "inequality, finance, money, banking, liquidity, default, long-run unemployment..."
        What hope for the "unsophisticated mind"? Well geez, oh look, a bank is a thing. There, the unsophisticated mind caught a flaw in the model.

        It never occurred to me before this election that voters without college degrees outnumber those with by 3 to 1.
        It doesn't matter if you can't target them as a group. But if you can and one party locks them up, that party dominates.
        When Trump said "I love the poorly educated," I thought he meant because they were credulous. But they are also numerous.

        Muslim-hating conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney joins Trump's transition team https://interc.pt/2fWh5r3  by @tinyrevolution

        It appears that Frank Gaffney is merely "advising" Trump rather than being an official part of his transition teamhttps://interc.pt/2fxdClU

        I was going to do a new version of the website to go with this announcement but, fuck it, we'll do it live! Welcome, @lvh!https://twitter.com/lvh/status/798701046055006208 ... 
        I mean, the website is updated and @lvh is on it now. But if you've seen https://latacora.com  already, well, you've seen it.
        Also, @lvh pretty much looks exactly like his Twitter picture.

        The question is: to what constituency is he appealing with Frank Gaffney? None of the rally crowd voters know who he is. GOP _hates_ him.
        I was momentarily relieved that Christie was evicted from Trump team. 
        Christie, it seems, get ousted because he was _too much of a straight shooter_ for Trump's son-in-law:http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/trump-transition.html?_r=0&referer=https://news.google.com/ ...

        You don't even need to tell the GOP not to normalize Frank Gaffney. They know. They kicked him out of CPAC.
        UNLESS HE'S A GENIUS and Gaffney is just there so we freak out about the crazy people while they do the real upsetting work.
