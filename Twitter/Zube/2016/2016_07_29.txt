        I don't think of Biden as the world's most dynamic, inspiring speaker, but this is a very impressive performance.
        The Alpaca was apparently apprehended.https://twitter.com/SamPhillipsPHL/status/758475294395301888 ... 
        No electo el Trumpo. Los egotisticalo billionairos should no esta be electedo.
        Oh Bloomberg, please stop saying sensible stuff I agree with.
        Bloomberg looked terrified by the applause.
        Tim Kaine's actual Secret Service codename is "Daredevil".
        Anne Holton's (Tim "Daredevil" Kaine's spouse)'s codename is more staid: "Dogwood".
        I believe candidates pick their own codenames (families share the same first letter, assigned by the WH Communications Agency)
        Trump is "Mogul", fwiw. I don't think Pence's has been disclosed.
        As I've mentioned, I'm assuming mine would be "Clumsy". Or maybe just "Oops".
        We can keep him from becoming President with a few minutes of voting. The vile bigotry and hatred he's tapped into will take longer.
        Or more like a C-
        It's unfortunate that our language has relatively few words for what's scary about Trump that don't also lump him in with the mentally ill.

        As the New Republic's David Dayen reports below, political conventions have always been collection points for big...http://fb.me/1fHH6Cs6x 
        Democrats really, really love their political leaders.
        71% of Americans are angry or somewhat angry about the state of the country. Do you think this convention is addressing that anger?
        It has been mixed so far. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren spoke to the anger, acknowledged deep problems. Others mostly did not.
        When Clinton accepts the nomination, how will she handle this dynamic? Swing voters tend to watch the acceptance speech, very little else.
        Angry people normally like being told "calm down, everything's fine" in my experience.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/758643454897299456 ... 
        In that 71% of Americans who are angry or somewhat angry, I'd be curious to know what they are angry about. Differences here matter.
        I'm guessing that the campaigns have deep polling data on this.
        Polling on anger in America is on p. 11. http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/25/trump.clinton.poll.pdf ...

        "You know what I'd like to see? Kids eating local food in schools, drinking local milk." Simple, straightforward. Good for @ZephyrTeachout
        "We shouldn't have so much unused farmland--dairy farms out of business--and still be shipping milk from California."
        "A few big $$ interests take money out of local economies and push it towards the big Ag monopolies."
        "As one dairy farmer told me, 'every dime spent on a local farm turns over 7 times in the community.'" - @ZephyrTeachout
