        Foer on DNS-gate: "The story required voyaging deep into the arcana of the internet". No, which is why it was debunked on Twitter in minutes
        The IP record route option is "Internet arcana". WHOIS lookups are something they explain in For Dummies books.
        "I spoke with many DNS experts. They found the evidence strongly suggestive" I have no trouble believing this about "DNS experts."
        Foer's follow-up piece in Slate is uniformly awful. Doesn't find Cendyn in Spamhaus, ergo: wasn't sending bulk email.
        He's keeping the story alive because Paul Vixie vouched for it. He says that.
        Actual HN headline: "Experimental Edge-Side Mustache Processing In Varnish". 
        Three days into open enrollment and http://Healthcare.gov  is still putting web browsers on hold before they log in.
        One reason small OpenSSL alternative libraries are so bad is that they don't use OpenSSL's libcrypto.
        That sounds weird, but the fact is that OpenSSL is two libraries, not one: the SSL stack, and the crypto primitives.
        If you write an OpenSSL replacement that isn't "allowed" to use libcrypto, you're simultaneously picking up two very difficult problems.
        And so you get, for instance, BOTH failure to do the anti-BB'98 dance in TLS, AND the missing curve parameter validation in curve primitives
        I am still on hold with http://Healthcare.gov . This is sad.
