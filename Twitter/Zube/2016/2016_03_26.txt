        @JZdziarski our only disclosure of the PoC has been direct communication with Apple to have them fix the issue
        @flyryan @JZdziarski uncertain on so many levels, Inverse Path priority is and has always been to improve security and responsibly disclose
        @flyryan @JZdziarski for this reason we prioritised accurate and efficient reporting rather than "weaponization" of the finding
        It's Cellebrite!
        Sun Corp, parent of Cellebrite, stock rose 36% since Reuters story suggested Celebrite was helping FBI hack iPhone https://www.inverse.com/article/13333-built-on-looney-tunes-pinball-sun-corp-is-making-bank-hacking-apple-for-the-fbi ... 
        Based on facts in the media, Cellebrite is working with John McAfee to socially engineer two dead terrorists using acid and laser photons.
        Reporter: (copying the chip) FBI Tried it?
        Reporter: Not a company you'd ever worked with before?

        NAND copy may or may not be what was used, but if you look at scalability and efficacy of an exploit, NAND is what I'd want if I was FBI.
        Someone should just come forward, preferably Cellebrite, and be like look... it was us. It wasn't. Sry for hogging media but remember the name

        The FP community objecting to negative reactions of Lambda Conf allowing a neo-nazi speaker signals that I'm probably not welcome there.
        The most disgusting part is how they hijacked the "tolerance" narrative, comparing criticism of a white supremacist to racial discrimination
        It makes me incredibly sad for the state of this industry that LambdaConf characterizes being pro-slavery as "different beliefs."
        I enjoy giving away my labour to rad communities -- and the way those communities respond determines everything about the interaction
        last year I decided to retreat from F/OSS a bunch, because I realised a good chunk of those interactions weren't healthy
        if I've contributed to your F/OSS project over the past year or so: gold star for you--I decided your project was rad enough to get involved
        carefully considering what communities to contribute to has gotten me a year full of great interactions, and I'm super thankful for that
        @SwiftOnSecurity Years ago I tried to do some Firefox development. It was like opening your car hood and finding rubber bands.

        "I'll uninvite him if you give me a consistent set of logical principles for when someone should come" -> "fuck off, find another friend"
        There is no more cowardly response than "diversity" when inviting speakers who think other humans are inferior due to race
        Yes, this is a stupid parody account.

        Tay has been been sent to therapy with ELIZA.
        Assuming the FBI is "stupid" and/or "evil" is a poor starting point for progress on crypto. Issue is less malice than limited perspective.
        The FBI investigates genuinely serious crimes, some involving electronic evidence. Pretending otherwise will not advance your argument.
        It's also true that law enf sometimes abuses its authority, and that there are alternatives was to collect some evidence. World is complex.
        I apologize in advance if non-reductive views upset you.

        r vs. k strategy.
        NPM is r - lots of low-energy low-investment 'offspring' (and a lot of participants, because it's a low bar to participate).
        If they succeed, the community as a whole will take on their 'DNA' - the favorable mutations are included into other packages.
        Langs with stdlib, OTOH, are k - strategy. Fewer developers. Much higher bar to entry. Lots of energy used to maintain 'em.
        Innovations happen comparatively slowly.
        So basically, leftpad was a highly successful mutation that happened to have a critical environmental vulnerability...
        ...which ended up nearly driving a bunch of other organisms to extinction that depended on its' genetic sequence.

        This is the new IL anti-trans bill and it is creepy as hell. http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=4474&GAID=13&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=88&GA=99 ... 
        It will fail, but it should fail in the most embarrassing possible way for the creeps who are backing it.
        There are trans kids in my kids school. As a parent: creepy state legislators, do not fuck with children in my kids school.
        I don't understand why people think their community is strengthened by the tension between people who believe in slavery and those who don't
        It's tough because there are some clearly smart people who quietly believe lots of things I don't understand and many of them are right.
        But I cannot get past scientific racism or sexism. There's a fuse in my brain for every person I meet and that shit just blows it.
        Crypto-racism, "I'm not racist I'm just using 10000 words leading you to inevitable conclusion of superiority of white race" so much worse.
        It's like the message board nerd version of the  Louis CK bit about saying "the n-word" instead of "nigger".
        I actually had to waste time reading Carlyle to verify for myself that I wasn't crazy about that dude. Unforgivable.

        I don't agree with him about CBC vs CTR (I used to), but I think he has a point about HMAC.
        Basically Guttman is concerned that a single failure in Daniel J. Bernstein could compromise all Internet cryptography.
        We should therefore place Bernstein in a cryogenic freezing facility so that no harm can come to him. I'm sure the IETF agrees.
        My nomination for next addition to AGL's Cryptographic Room 101: block ciphers.
        Possible subtext to the Cryptographic Monoculture Argument: "crypto is converging on a set of standard constructions and they are boring".
        Next person on HN to say DJB's designs are "so tight", I'm going to ask them to explain why Curve25519 and not PinkBikeShed.
