        And the recriminations b/n the Clinton and Obama machines start. You campaigned badly! You governed badly! Democratic sacred cow face-off...
        You didn't prosecute a single elite banker! You didn't put any resources in Wisconsin! Obamacare sucks! You had no message!
        All of this presented with "Obama's the most elegant wonderful man" and "Anyone who thinks Clinton was corrupt is in Putin's pocket"
        Why did you screw unions? Why did YOU have a damn foundation? You didn't do anything about inequality? What's up with YOUR email server?
        Of course let's agree that the BernieBros are terrible and the Intercept is fake news. Oh yeah of course. But you screwed Wisconsin! Yeah?!?

        Love seeing PoC's come into the bug bounty with cracked versions of Burp in the video, such ethical hacking
        And @Carinetinc spamming their services, touting that @Rapid7 @secureauth are customers.
        We work hard, design complex mitigations, rewrite code, debate the details. Attacks in 2016? Same as 2000:

        Been coding anti-reversing techniques for Linux. I've pushed a repo and a "book" with techniques / analysis. Enjoy:https://github.com/antire-book/dont_panic ...

        As many of you said and I agree, vulnerability severity depends on context. "Typically" may mean e.g. "on average across many issues rated".

        Hey, everyone: if you see a sponsored tweet in your timeline offering to get you Twitter Verified...don't do it.
        1) I am working on an analysis of two things for an upcoming article, though they may seem unrelated: Shadowbrokers and the Dem party hacks.
        2/ Fancy Bear is not some single hacking operation, but a bunch of teams using related tools. Some of them are obviously not A team.
        3/ Meanwhile @thegrugq did an interesting analysis of Shadowbrokers' latest "sale" of stolen NSA hack tools. It implies SB is Russian.
        4/ That in turn implies a number of possibilities about how SB got the tools. But also, it raises some major WTFs.
        5/ With the request I got from @FancyBears to write about their @usantidoping hack last week, I started thinking about the layers of disinfo
        6/ On the one hand we have an op (SB) that has timed its info releases in a way that looks to be tailored to screw w/ NSA directly.
        7/ On the other we have somebody DMing journos about writing about "scandalous" Olympic administrivia.
        8/ Does anyone sense some dissonance here?
        9/ The @CrowdStrike report on Fancy Bear Android malware being used to target Ukraine artillery throws another weird variable into the mix.
        10/ So, I'll be doing my crazy "Homeland" style OCD diagrams over the holidays to sort all this out. Anyone who wants to help, tweet at me.
        Correct me if I'm wrong, but can't the 4s be brute forced w/ @ElcomSoft tools?http://thehackernews.com/2016/12/russian-ambassador-assassination.html?m=1 ... 
        At least they were when I tested it.http://arstechnica.com/features/2014/09/ipwned-mining-iphones-icloud-for-personal-data-is-terrifying-simple/ ... 
        Holiday cheer.https://twitter.com/randpaul/status/812316019385663488 ... 
        @thepacketrat Probably no need to brute-force an old iPhone 4s - lock screen bypass may work just fine.
        On the media & #fakenews: Festivus is real, media, so don't try 2 fact check it. And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report
        New administration is lookin good. Haven't seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ Alex Jones. Good times.
        .@peterthiel is advising the President Elect. That's great. But his plan 2 make the Statue of Liberty into a digital stop sign is a bit much
        And so on.  And so on. Go ahead, read the whole thread.https://twitter.com/randpaul/status/812318465184907266 ...
