        Now I need to write YET ANOTHER REd protocol implementation just because CSR decided to do their own undocumented thing
        Oh FFS it's even in ECB mode what's the fucking point
        They're light switches basically the only attack is other people turning them on and off REPLAY ATTACKS ARE YOUR ENTIRE THREAT MODEL
        Great sending it malformed packets makes it crash
        I can't turn off my lights because my light switch needs to be power cycled
        The future is awful

        If you have no proof, then you're essentially building a list to harass people - usually minorities, in this case.
        If you do have proof, then this DB is useless - you should be investigating and prosecuting as a criminal action.
        Either way, whoever's sticking infants on the list is behaving unethically in the extreme - especially if the DB is ever used elsewhere.
        Because if you're on a 'bad list' as an infant, you're condemned to a lifetime of suspicion for no reason whatsoever.
        Which I suppose makes sense if you're really heavy into Calvinism....but not to anyone else.
        Seriously though! Some cop is condemning an infant to a life unable to get a good job.pic.twitter.com/kMpzB4I0gB

        So there exists at least read access to current light state.
        Now, benignly, between that and some means of understanding traffic patterns, this'd make for much expedited trips.
        And used cooperatively, would greatly reduce traffic congestion, making things much smoother.
