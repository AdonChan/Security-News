        Is Paul Graham really saying that YC got in hot water over Thiel because he let himself be trolled?https://twitter.com/paulg/status/788338042847232000 ... 
        Hopefully the troll he's referring to is Thiel. If it's @dhh, then this is a really bad example of how dissent = trolling in the dude's mind
        But hey, at least it got YC in the national press! Now a lot of people know who they are, and will presumably study other combinators
        Accusing @dhh of trolling is weaksauce, let alone subtweeting it, @paulg. That's weenis behavior
        It's the long con! RT @jmfinn: @Pinboard If it broadens interest in studying lambda calculus all of 2016 will have been worth it.
        But why *male models*? RT @steveklabnik: @Pinboard this media push is just what Lisp needs to finally break into the mainstream
        @Pinboard i bought the IOT one and set up a lambda function. i am very happy with it.
        RT @bnwlfsn: @Pinboard graham is a passed master of the K combinator, which ignores one of its arguments.
        Calling @dhh a troll for arguing with him is worse than anything @paulg has said about Thiel.
        I encourage @paulg to read the part about the "lowest form of disagreement" here before calling @dhh a troll again http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html 
        @dhh Ultimately, this isn't a legal issue -- it's a moral one. Stand up and be counted or stop complaining about Trump, @paulg.
        Look at all these Twitter trolls, calling Thiel a monster and criticizing YC. By Graham logic, that must mean YC is doing something right!
        First they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they point out flagrant contradictions in your position, then you call them a troll
        Big opportunity out there for a fixed-point combinator that doesn't condone bigotry
        When you occupy the moral high ground, be sure to bring supplemental oxygen, so your thinking doesn't get muddy

        People complaining about having to give their phone numbers to websites, but if we had cranial cryptoprocessor implants we wouldn't need to.
        Take every baby, implant a biologically-powered cryptoprocessor around their brain stem, install subdermal control pad, security is solved.
        Instead of whining about everything, try to be part of the solution.
        Okay I'm going to try that again, first time I didn't convey the facts clearly.
        Friend found an attacker using an exploit against a commercial commerce system, he isolated the exploit, they don't believe him, want video.
        I told him to launch Wireshark, point his iPhone at the screen, and take a video.

        Reading @thenewjimcrow is like reading a Donald Trump dog whistle decoder book.
        Trump won't be only one refusing to accept defeat. McCain says GOP obstruction will cont. w/Clinton SCOTUS nomineeshttp://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/mccain-vows-court-blockade-through-clintons-presidency.html?mid=facebook_nymag ... 
        What is the GOP about now other than fascism, obstructionism, misogyny, self-pity and turning America into a giant safe space for racists
        And it sucks for a lot of reasons, one of which is that all the shitty things abt the Democratic wing of the party are eclipsed as a result.
        The Dem wing is awful and the GOP wing is far worse. Gotten so bad, there's gotta be room for something better to coalesce in the vacuum.
        Yes. "If I can't have it, neither can anyone else. I'll blow it up. Then you'll be sorry. You'll know you should never have opposed me."https://twitter.com/twliterary/status/788176603859693568 ... 
        Which is the classic stalker mentality. "Won't love me? Okay, but I'll still matter to you--by hurting you. I win either way."
        Obama could pardon Gen Cartwright & pardon #Snowden too.http://cnn.it/2ehqG01 
        Indeed: "If he loses, Trump says, it will be due to cheating. If he wins, he will imprison his defeated opponent."
        From @mtaibbi, the best article I've read yet on the 2016 election.

        So if Sam's not firing Peter Thiel is the high bit of his reputation for you, you prize orthodoxy over actions.

        Second. This notion of "we should talk to each other more, not less" is such a privileged white male point of view that it hurts.
        Not only does talking rarely work to change views (as has been proven), but it assumes people haven't *been* talking.
        that is fully 2016https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/788149909505519617 ... 
        Just be wrong, @sama. IT IS OK TO BE WRONG. You are very much allowed to be.
        @tqbf @EricaJoy her tweets have been the thing that have come the closets to convincing me my principle may be wrong.
        The movement(s) behind Trump are the *response* to our voices. They are power trying to retain power. They are the death throes of supremacy

        Tim Berners-Lee: I need 1 more week to invent the internet
        "Apparently, Sam Altman and Paul Graham don't believe Trump to be a big enough threat to cut ties over him". That's why this matters.
        This is what people really believe: Altman's insistence on standing by Thiel means that they must be missing something about DONALD TRUMP.
        Altman and Graham don't mean to cast doubt on the opposition to Donald Trump. They are both terrified of him. But that's what they're doing!
        Reminder: when Trump campaigns again in 2019, no opposition research will have the power to halt his campaign; newsworthiness all spent.
        His 2020 primary win will be a referendum on the legitimacy of the candidacy of a predator and a bigot. It will dispose of the issue.
        I am not getting tired of this but I am starting to lose my place and also my business partners are going to murder me.
