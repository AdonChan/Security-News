        I went and saw The Arrival and highly recommend.  You know I'm boring when seeing a movie (not on an airplane) is a big deal.

        @Pinboard in practice, generally no. The statute hasn't been amended but state laws (esp in CA!) and good court decisions ...
        @Pinboard ... mean that (major) companies do require a warrant for almost all content almost all the time
        @Pinboard so, statute hasn't changed but in 6th Circuit and elsewhere there's a legal warrant req, and DOJ (currently) complies everywhere

        "The CIA has been wrong about things" is a reason to evaluate them with a critical ear, not to ignore all US intel product. This is insane.

        The lunacy going on around Trump's win is designed to do one thing and one thing only: Avoid introspection for the establishment's failure.
        The political and media establishment ended their deal with the public. The final straw was the taking of the American home in 2008.
        'How dare you not trust the press/CIA/government/experts!?!' - Well because they are coasting on credibility long since squandered.
        Autocracy is a function of our internal political economy, aka domestic actors. Many of us noticed the signs along the way.
        Tim Robbins made a remarkably prescient movie Bob Roberts noting the cultural signposts.
        There was enormous anger as the farm belt was destroyed in the 1980s by high interest rates.
        African-American life spans dropped in the 1980s b/c of industrial policy. Now it's hitting rural white America.
        Plenty of signs. I wrote a piece in 2012 not just predicting autocracy and populism, but observing it. http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&context=ulj ... 
        Trump is different. How different isn't clear. But he's knocking the 'free market' as 'the dumb market'. He's knocking China and the CIA.
        Trump seeks perhaps to extend the autocracy that has descended on much of the country over the rest of it. Different. But not different.
        Pharma execs addicting and killing Americans. This is autocracy for those families and communities affected.http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/12/09/executives_at_major_fentanyl_producer_arrested_in_overprescription_case.html ... 
        And yes, one can point out the crisis with Trump and how it emerged out of Dem policy failures. But, say, Krugman, isn't doing the latter.
        It's always a humblebrag failure of some sort, the job interview what's my weakness 'I'm too much of a perfectionist' or 'I work too hard'.
        Russia didn't gerrymander, suppress voting, buy voting machines that are uncheckable or shut down the recount. Republicans did that. 1/2https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/808304894994161664 ... 
        The 'we did everything we could but excuse #1 #2 #3' argument is deeply cynical. it's democracy can't work. It's people can't self-govern.
        But we can self-govern. We can be free. We can live in a more just world. That is the American ideal. But we must be honest with ourselves.
        It's now literally treasonous - literally - to question or doubt the CIA's claims, says the president of @EurasiaGroup.https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/807958133301800960 ...
