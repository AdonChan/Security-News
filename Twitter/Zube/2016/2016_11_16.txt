        Years ago, when I spoke at YearlyKos, I met many bright young things who looked forward to being well-paid state apologists.
        Trump has relegated them to oppositional status, and they're not pleased. Resistance isn't sexy.

        All the Trump supporters who got angry because we called them bigots when they're "not" still thought it was OK to vote for a bigot.
        Instead of giving Trump a chance, I sure wish USA had chosen to give BLM, women, immigrants, muslims, refugees, LGBTQ persons, etc a chance
        After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming "you LOST!"  Will be ugly.
        Now we know: reminding Trump that he's a popular vote loser really annoys him. So let's keep doing it.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/798519600413601792 ... 
        And please, stop calling them the "Alt-right". They aren't a 90s grunge band, they're fascists. We've got a word for that already: fascists.
        While it seems nice to imagine the Electoral College rejecting Trump, just imagine the riots and constitutional crisis if it happened >.<
        The "alt-right" makes no sense sometimes. They're against gay rights, but Peter Thiel and Milo Yiannopoulos are two of their champions? >.<
        I don't know how the United States is going to survive its current division. Rural and urban lifestyles are too different. #Hopeless
        Not all Trump supporters are racist. However, all of them decided that racism isn't a deal breaker. #NotMyPresident #ImWithHer

        I appreciate Obama's conciliatory words about the incoming administration, but Trump's first major staff pick is still a white supremacist.
        Cheap Android handset secretly sent all text message content to a server in China.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html ... 
        This one didn't, but it's not far-fetched to imagine a handset that also routinely records and uploads all call audio, too.
        It's entirely plausible that this was done solely for marketing reasons, but that still means the (Chinese) intel agencies can get the data.
        This is what frightens me most about making everything part of ad networks. They become pre-deployed spying systems at the flip of a switch.
        And the fact that you might trust a particular government doesn't help when the ad network is controlled in a different country.
        This is the likely future of IoT, too. Your lightbulbs quietly report "how they're used", for "marketing purposes only", of course.
        Until the inauguration, we basically have the "Friday news dump" for two months straight.  And then for four years straight.
        Obama sure has waited a long time to start gun confiscation, implement Sharia law, and open the FEMA camps. I guess it will be any day now.

        @matthewstoller To do list when you fail miserably:

        Democratic antitrusters and Republican antitrusters agree. Concentration is good and economists are always right!https://twitter.com/MartinSGaynor/status/798511725029052417 ... 
        It's time to make competition policy based on fact, not theory.https://twitter.com/profwrightgmu/status/798526689282293760 ... 
        @Econ_Marshall I agree. Same question. You want your empirical cites from CEA or Nobel prize winner? Obama DOJ? Top Econ journals?
        @ProfWrightGMU I was at an interesting FTC microeconomics conference 2 weeks ago. Panel was unanimous on this point. You plan to overrule?
        @EnriqueDiazAlva @matthewstoller that to do list sounds remarkably similar to how bankers reacted to the financial crisis...

        Hard to describe how infuential Theda Skocpol is. I have talked to Dem policymakers who worship the ground she walks on.
        This is Democratic elite culture. People who are super-smart, well thought of, highly credentialed. And disastrous.https://twitter.com/wesinjapan/status/798562634555658242 ...

        @matthewstoller These new weights, operating within existing analytic framework, could be informed by our shared democratic values 2/2
        To be clear, I support vigorous antitrust enforcement & I'm concerned about increasing concentration. @ProfWrightGMU 1/nhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/798530402768089088 ... 
        However, I don't think big necessarily equals bad. Going back to that would be a major mistake. @ProfWrightGMU 2/3https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/798530402768089088 ... 
        Trump is the actual cost of the bailouts.
        Using antitrust for a political agenda would be a major mistake. It would destroy its effectiveness and credibility. 3/4 @ProfWrightGMUhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/798530402768089088 ...

        Maybe you don't remember but many were sounding the alarm over the threats posed by the Patriot Act & other powers given blindly to gov't.
        But protestors were labeled terrorist sympathizers & average Americans couldn't care less if an Ay-rab was tortured if it made them safer.

        When someone aware of web browser vulns does that (OK, in sandbox), surely things are not exactly right with "behavior"-based authentication
        Thank you, Google, for asking me for more of my personal info I don't want to share, so that, as you put it, I "don't get locked out".
