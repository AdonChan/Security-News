        Google enables HSTS on http://www.google.com , ensuring the first browser request doesn't go over hijackable HTTP https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/bringing-hsts-to-wwwgooglecom.html ... 
        @SwiftOnSecurity Because this is the way it's *supposed* to work, not a browser workaround.
        IE11/Edge/Chrome/Firefox already preload many important Google domains as requiring security, like the login page, but not the www subdomain
        @SwiftOnSecurity Some Google properties are preloaded, but not http://google.com : https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json?l=238 ... 
        Why HSTS is important:
        If a MITM intercepts the initial browser connection, the browser never gets told to use HTTPS, so there isn't an error. Unless HSTS is used.
        @SwiftOnSecurity Anyone can get their domain HSTS preloaded in browsers so that no plaintext requests are ever sent: https://hstspreload.appspot.com 
        @SwiftOnSecurity Without preloading the first request to a domain is still vulnerable, even with HSTS. HSTS secures the subsequent requests.
        .@titanous Yes sorry I wasn't clear about that. I was basing protection on the preload HSTS, and long-duration timeouts of HSTS headers
        There's so many caveats in security implementation information, makes it super hard to communicate. But I try.

        Hacking by foreign adversaries to influence US elections illustrates why FBI proposals to weaken computer security are so misguided.
        FBI, to be fair, says that their crypto proposals WON'T weaken security, but overwhelming consensus by tech experts is that they will.
        This is not a partisan issue or a "privacy vs. security" tradeoff. Strong computer security & crypto protects our society's infrastructure.
        Before you cheer too hard, the same insecure software that the politician you hate uses, is also used by your bank, power co, and hospital.
