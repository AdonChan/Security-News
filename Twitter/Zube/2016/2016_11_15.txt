        States are constitutionally empowered to apportion electors as they see fit. They can thus end the Electoral Collegehttps://twitter.com/SummerlinJTLV/status/798183624205996032 ... 
        Many defending Electoral College basically insinuate NY & CA voters are subhuman & don't deserve equal voting rightshttps://twitter.com/TimFlobug/status/798183853806358528 ... 
        You can think Trump is legit president-elect & Electoral College is "a disaster for democracy," as Trump said. These things can both be true
        A system that gives 1.3 million people in Wyoming & North Dakota as much Senate representation as 65 million people in Texas & California is
        States are already on the way to eliminating the Electoral College -- and they don't need a constitutional amendmenthttp://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/donald-trump-election-may-renew-push-end-electoral-college-elect-presidents ...

        Never forget: many establishment Dems like this are just as hostile towards investigative nonpartisan journalism as partisans on the righthttps://twitter.com/adamwinkler/status/798218090953588736 ... 
        Also: Im proud of the Clinton reporting we did, and of the many stories we did scrutinizing the GOP, including this: http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/how-donald-trump-used-fine-print-make-it-harder-sue-wall-street-fraud-2440890 ... https://twitter.com/adamwinkler/status/798218090953588736 ... 
        Some argue that those who worked hardest to elect Trump were those who ignored warnings & engineered Dems' nomination of a flawed candidatehttps://twitter.com/adamwinkler/status/798218090953588736 ... 
        "Liberals put Trump in the White House" - @kurteichenwaldhttp://www.newsweek.com/myths-cost-democrats-presidential-election-521044 ... 
        Things I learned on Twitter: Democratic Party officials, Clinton and her aides bear zero responsibility for losing the election.
        America circa 2016: where journalistically scrutinizing candidates is now equated with "working to defeat them"https://twitter.com/adamwinkler/status/798233521399599104 ... 
        Clinton had a billion-dollar campaign, but she lost because of @lhfang @ggreenwald and me. Also, I hear that ignorance is strength.
        The most butthurt people on Twitter are pundits still transcribing Clinton campaign talking points & doing oppo dumps on Sanders. Get a life
        It's over. She lost. You guaranteed the future we now face because you backed a flawed candidate. Deal with it.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/798236718369382400 ... 
        "The problem wasn't me or my flawed candidate, it was journalistic scrutiny," said every lobotomized partisan shill after a losing election.
        "Trump threatens press freedom & journalists must be even more loyal propaganda agents for Dems" - do you see the contradiction there?
        @davidsirota One of the most disturbing things to come out of this election is partisan dems demanding a shield from journalists.

        As a cryptographer, I'm glad to see more advocacy of security tools. But I'm uneasy at the subtext - that dissent should go underground.
        Don't get me wrong: security and crypto tools are critically important to many people, and need more use. Just want to maintain perspective.
        Remember: Using crypto does not by itself make you a heroic revolutionary. You'll need a beret, too.

        I think I understand Trump's plan to bring back jobs to US: 1/ Ease out of NATO, and wait for Russia to invade Baltic states.
        2/ Watch as NATO remnants and Russia fight a major ground war. As world trade collapses, take US into war economy.
        3/ Declare embargo on Asian trade. Default on US debt held by China.
        4/ Sell nukes to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Tell them to work things out with China.
        5/ Total collapse of world trade brings all jobs back to US. Plus Trumperica gets all the reconstruction contracts with nuked countries
        Hate to say it: big legal firms and old school investigative journos matter much more to defend against Trump than Silicon Valley.

        Stop freaking out about Bannon. That's his job: to make you freak out about him while Priebus guts the social safety net. STOP.
        The more we ignore him, the crazier shit this administration will say. Their whole playbook depends on us freaking out.
        There is something worth freaking out about: POLICY. POLICY ONLY. Not fucking racist frogs.
        Resisters: don't set up mailing lists. Set up small private wikis. Disable caching, routinely delete old content.

        There has to be an easier way to score the invite to Ted Nugent's ranch than starting a racist bulletin board system.
