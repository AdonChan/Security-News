        I guess one has more success talking with a wall of bricks than with an @appstore reviewer.
        I love how Bill from AppStoreReview ends every mail with: if you gave questions about this info, please reply. And his answer is always same
        So no: Bill from @AppStore review does not answer questions he only pastes the same textblock over and over again.
        Well someone told me that there has been an internal Apple order to not let our App in under any circumstances. I guess that was not a joke.
        . @AdamLangePL bill is maybe just the poor guy who has the order from above to not let our App at any cost. He obviously has not arguments.

        13. Twelve Federal Reserve banks finance most research on macro-economic monetary policy and allegiance to the Fed is thus widespread.
        14. But that's relatively rare. Mostly what's happening is that our public institutions are increasingly unable to 'think'.
        15. So now we have a private governance system. That's why this NYT piece is a bit off. The reporters are not wrong. But it's an open secret
        16. Not really a secret. It's known. In some ways policymakers listen to Brookings b/c they know the policy has been vetted by corporations.
        17. This article should be a story of how governance works. Instead it's a 'did you know there are conflicts of interest' tut tut posture.
        18. I mean this private governance system is 22 years old. Aren't we beyond the 'how dare this exist' point?
        19. I actually suspect that there's increasingly less and less work done even in the private think tank world. That system is breaking down.
        20. In fact what may be happening is that increasingly no one's in charge. Increasingly no one's thinking. Even the corruption is failing.
        21. Absent diversity of financing you get the death of debate, the death of ideas, the death of thinking, and the destruction of leadership.
        22. Anyway we just have to begin to understand this not just as anomalous instances of corruption, but as a system for organizing ideas.
        Agreed. OTA. Was. Amazing.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/762454259380080640 ... 

        23. And now for the good news. And yes there is good news. The Library of Congress has a new librarian. The LOC is a jewel.
        24. With a more modern outlook it can have a transformative impact on this problem.
        25. And two, people are beginning to notice. Rep. Mark Takano nearly succeeded in restoring money for the OTA. https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/house-section/article/H3683-1 ... 
        26. Takano is a relatively new member of Congress, super-smart, thoughtful. The new generation of members may get that there's a problem.
        Actually, the DSG did such good work that a significant group of Republicans relied on it as well.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/762455068020846600 ... 

        Yes, & still need OTA. Other good news: data science & open data reduced cost of policy research, & folks diving in.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/762462053017591808 ...
