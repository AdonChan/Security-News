        The only thing eclipsing the number of let's encrypt websites are the number of critical SSL vulnerabilities.
        Not passing judgment on anyone, but if Tim Cook blocks you then you must be a douche bag.

        ISIS apologizes for this data breach. Like you, we were shocked to see that many in this world seek only to cause harm and damage to others.
        ISIS recommends you never share personal information with other jihadists over the phone, email or text. Be wary of suspicious emails.
        ISIS will never ask you to provide your jihadi network password or personal sensitive information over email. Thank you for your loyalty.
        For anyone just tuning in, that was a FAKE ISIS data breach letter, also known as satire. I do not support or represent ISIS in any way.

        I have a story.
        So I'm playing Fallout Shelter, where you control people in a shelter after an apocalypse. You expand population through birth.
        The stats of the baby are dependent on the stats of the parents. So I spend days leaving up a guy and woman to top stats. Maxed out.
        So I take the man and woman, top physical and mental specimens, and put them in a bedroom. Baby making time. pic.twitter.com/gZtJ9TQzHK
        But they just stand there. I come back hours later. Still no action. Dead bedroom. They're not feeling it at all. Very confused.
        I put the woman in "nightwear" with no effect. I stick him with some sweet silk pajamas. Still absolutely nothing happening. I wait a day.
        So I'm like pulling my hair out. I need a baby. Make the baby. Then I see it. I figured out why they're not doing it.
        They have the same last name.

        PoC||GTFO 0x11 will be released next week.
        Next week, I'll present in Heidelberg: caring about file formats. pic.twitter.com/3JxGdRXZRr
        Coincidentally, PoC||GTFO 0x11 may not be a completely standard file ;)
        "Completely" as in "standards are subject to interpretation anyway" ;)
        Second tutorial to attack white-boxes got published: 
        Who in Switzerland is good at heap exploitation on linux and can provide a day of training? I'd pay in crashes with unknown exploitability
        Once again, my latest drawing (for PoC||GTFO) accidentally failed my printer. I'm starting to take it personally.
        nice & interactive representation of Bezier curve drawing

        ISIS apologizes for this data breach. Like you, we were shocked to see that many in this world seek only to cause harm and damage to others.
        ISIS recommends you never share personal information with other jihadists over the phone, email or text. Be wary of suspicious emails.
        ISIS will never ask you to provide your jihadi network password or personal sensitive information over email. Thank you for your loyalty.

        "It's the Queen, it's the Queen / She's a bit out of touch and homophobic, old bean." -- my proposed new national anthem
        With all the new downloadable swear words you can get these days it's easy to forget the old vinyl classics such as 'fucking bastard'.
        "You're a fucking bastard," we used to say to cheery policemen on the beat. Nowadays it's all 'pisswhippet' this and 'clockwork nonce' that.
        I mean, if a hooded youth of today called a policeman a 'fart ribbed knuckle fucker' they'd be shot in the face and sent to Guantanamo Bay.
        But that's how it is now. The kids get a new swear word almost every day from iTunes. One called me a 'milky flan' the other day. No idea.

        Contra @matthew_d_green, I do not believe "crowdsourced" bug hunts are superior to audits, like, even a little bit.
        What I DO believe is that the 1pw2 audit RFA would have bought for libotr was inferior to the attention it has already had.
        That's why Matt and I bet: he said "this code is a tire fire", and I said "nobody is going to find a bug in it this year". He disagreed.
        The context behind the bet was EFF's "Secure Messaging Scorecard", which ranked libotr below (yes, really) Cryptocat.
        Finally: I declare it to be OFFICIALLY CRAZY-TALK to suggest today's OTR bug would have died earlier but for the bet.
        If you think bets delay bug-finding, fine, don't ever bet against me. I will happily bet against other people, because I'm a degenerate.
        Is the subtext here that there are lots of white racist Democratic voters in Pennsylvania?
        It's like neither one of them wants to give the soundbite "Donald Trump is a racist". He obviously is!
        now one for senator sanders: what are your views on gmail's implementation of imap on external clients?
        "What some would call his-pandering"? Really?

        This is where calling-someone-racist-is-worse-than-racism gets you. Folks trying to find 53 synonyms for "racist" without getting in trouble
        @tqbf that it took this long for this libotr bug to be found basically confirms there are white, racist voters in Pennsylvania.
        Did Hilary Clinton just say she was "not a natural politician"?

        In fact if it's legit and checks out, it'll number well into 8 figures of exposed accounts. It's a very unusual breach though.
        This breach I'm looking at will likely take a few days to get to the bottom of, it's very unusual for a few reasons

        Facebook basically built Opera Mini (https://code.facebook.com/posts/1365439333482197/how-we-built-facebook-lite-for-every-android-phone-and-network/ ... ), except Opera Mini worked on J2ME. With 200MHz CPU and ~700kB of available RAM
        That was in 2009 too. How come JVM (maybe with Jazelle) on 200MHz + 700kB RAM is OK but native 600MHz and >16MB of RAM is "restrictive"?
        maybe when "connectivity in emerging markets" is something you never experienced, your solution is bound to be ridiculously wasteful
