        Trump's misogyny and boorishness may lose him the election, but the narrow view of America he represents will remain a chronic disease.

        Clinton's handling of classified info is a legit issue & cleared friends resent what they see as special treatment. But Trump is terrifying.

        The biggest lie in all of the documents. 
        I can't stop watching this. I'm not kidding, I can't stop. It might be the samizdat.https://twitter.com/cafedotcom/status/785902825838567424 ...
