        The only way my paper can get rejected is if there's cheating.
        Aside from the normalization of bigotry, etc. the other big casualty of this election is relative lack of policy debate. It's all freakshow,
        Not that US politics is ordinarily a hotbed of nuanced debate, but at least candidates normally spend some time defending serious positions
        I feel like all this election is doing is making us dumber and angrier.
        The @united "security questions" are basicallythe user authentication version of a roll-your-own crypto algorithm.
        No doubt, @united is trying to be innovative. That's the problem; airlines don't have resources or expertise to invent security mechanisms.
        Voting machines: Every time someone looks at one of these, they find the same thing. Why is there still a debate?!?http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rigged-presidential-elections-hackers-demonstrate-voting-threat-old-machines/ ... 
        Each election cycle, we re-notice that voting machines are an insecure hot mess just a bit too late to easily do anything about it.
        Obvious solution is optical scan ballots. Various election officials will now spend the next 6 moths explaining why that's impractical.
        One problem is voting systems are mostly paid for at the county level. Do you want better voting systems or, say, a new fire station?
