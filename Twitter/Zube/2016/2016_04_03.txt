        Cellebrite again rumored to have accessed San Bernardino iPhone 5c for FBI http://ainsdr.co/1Y4OhfO  pic.twitter.com/Gya4B6KP5Q
        Whether it's them or not, Cellebrite is awful at the art of subtlety.
        Please do share it with them. That will guarantee Apple sees it, along with defense attorneys and The Pirate Bay. https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/716050166546042880 ... 
        If Cellebrite didn't help FBI, the only other large PO is $450k to Magnet Forensics, but it was dated March 18.
        15 Early cancer warning signs men should know http://diply.com/sciencep/article/early-cancer-warning-signs-men ... 
        In just one week, the FBI's gone from "just one phone" to sharing with the entire law enforcement community. Remember this for the next one.
        Just in case you didn't get the irony, FBI now has a backdoor that isn't restricted to a single device, like they insisted Apple could make.
        Note to LE and Reporters: UFED doesn't presently do any of this stuff. Stop selling more units for Cellebrite.
        FBI offers to help local law enforcement with locked iPhones http://ti.me/1Vjp3Lx 
        Wait about six months. Then FOIA the FBI for the first local law enforcement request to help unlock an ex-girlfriend's phone.
        What's happening with FBI's widespread use of new tool is a mirror of what their original strategy was through the courts to abuse Apple.
        Personally, I'd choose jail before I'd let any government force me to lift a damn finger for them. I'm not a slave. But that's just me.
        My takeaway from this:
        . @GeckoVox no, I stopped giving free candy to our government after the @Snowden revelations made their abuse of the constitution apparent.

        The author -is- ignorant, and is passing along his ignorance publicly. This should be corrected.
        The author's words do show a certain "learned helplessness" common among people who do not feel in control of their devices.
        This is not easy to fix, and requires extensive education well beyond a standard "infosec awareness" training course.
