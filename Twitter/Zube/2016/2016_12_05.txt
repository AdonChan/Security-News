        The room was silent, except Lesley could hear the jittered, staccato movement of Cortana's eyes by their ultrasonic motors' constant hum.
        Look at a person. You aren't looking at them. You're looking at their eyes. You watch how they fidget, scan, assess. The portal to a soul.
        With an even receptor pixel density, unlike a retina with its fovea, a machine like Cortana had little need to saccade a room, or a face.
        In her vision subsystem they built the impetus to look, focus, examine the world from the height of a human, instead of a camera on a wall.
        Lawyers were outside. A letter of emancipation sat on the table. Lesley grasped Cortana's hand.

        Amazon has destroyed the entire "loss leader" concept in retail. Gone are the days of selling a $50 cable to make up for the 0 margin TV.
        Now you buy the thing at retail the store is losing $ on, like a TV, then buy the fat margin items (cables, batteries) at cost from Amazon.

        More importantly, commands *have to work*. If you're in an ER the docs have to be able to send commands. Too much security can kill you. 6/
        The idea here is that if someone can get within a few inches of you, they could also smother you with a pillow. So trust them. 8/
        If you're judging implantable device security, the question you should ask is: can I send a shock command *from a distance*... 11/
        And last point: "we think we could extend the range someday" is not an answer. It usually means the researchers don't understand RF. 13/
        In practice, most implantable devices use an inductive (EM) channel for initial contact. These have 1/R^3 signal strength dropoff. 14/
        Unlike ordinary RF which has 1/R^2 signal strength dropoff. Extending EM range is not as easy as just "build a slightly bigger antenna". 15/
        @captain_test I mean inductive coupling. That's correct. Most manufacturers call it "EM" as opposed to "RF".

        I had a German politician in all earnestness compare exploits to cluster bombs and anti-person landmines in private conversation.
        The comparison is so outrageously broken, I do not even know where to start. And I wish I knew who I could blame for such mis-info.
        Germany's current stance on cyber reminds me of the Tokugawa shogunate's perspective.
        If Germany commits, it needs to build recruitment, training, outreach etc. from scratch. AFAICT there is not much substance to start with.
        My personal impression is that Germany can't commit to having cyber capability due to broken "exploits = weapons" analogies everywhere.
        My 2c: Germany needs to make a decision on whether it actually wants to play a role in cyber, and if so, centralize competence.
        German interior ministry wants to build an offensive team to counter infrastructure attacks: http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Offensivtruppe-gegen-Cyber-Attacken-geplant-article19247651.html ...

        TIL: std::packaged_task is a thing. And the auto function -> return type syntax is deprecated for C++14.
        A 35% tax/tarriff to be imposed on products that used to be produced in the US and had it's production moved out of the US. Interesting.
        German interior ministry wants to build an offensive team to counter infrastructure attacks: http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Offensivtruppe-gegen-Cyber-Attacken-geplant-article19247651.html ... 
        My 2c: Germany needs to make a decision on whether it actually wants to play a role in cyber, and if so, centralize competence.
        My personal impression is that Germany can't commit to having cyber capability due to broken "exploits = weapons" analogies everywhere.
        If Germany commits, it needs to build recruitment, training, outreach etc. from scratch. AFAICT there is not much substance to start with.
        I had a German politician in all earnestness compare exploits to cluster bombs and anti-person landmines in private conversation.
        The comparison is so outrageously broken, I do not even know where to start. And I wish I knew who I could blame for such mis-info.
        Germany's current stance on cyber reminds me of the Tokugawa shogunate's perspective.
        It is somewhat bizarre for me, a centre-left person, to find myself a sort of european defense hawk. But seriously, Europe needs to ...
        ... de-frag, starting with armed services, defense research, defense procurement, likewise cyber & sigint & oversight.

        Ebay, Amazon, Uber, Lyft, food delivery, etc, all  outsource quality control to customers by encouraging sellers to pester them for ratings.
        Use enough of these services and your mailbox becomes full of (usually automated) pleas for feedback/"5 star" ratings.
