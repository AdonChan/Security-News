        I just sent six tweets about bagels to 150,000 people.
        Wow I just saw an Android phone update for the first time in my life.
        Some tool got a laptop approved with 16GB of RAM, running Windows 7 and a 500GB spinning disk drive. Just burn your developer salary.
        My empathy ends where your spinning disk drive begins.
        For the record, I spent years on WD VelociRaptors for my desktops because I didn't trust SSDs. There's no reason left anymore.

        Oh man the insider trading that will go on vis-a-vis the White House and Wall Street...
        My new interview--on economic concentration--When Did Americans Stop Being Antimonopoly? Q&A with Richard R. John -https://promarket.org/americans-stop-antimonopoly-q-richard-r-john/ ... 
        1. Actually, a few quick thoughts on these Sanders comments, which mix a strawman and innuendo in not-helpful wayshttp://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/21/13699956/sanders-clinton-democratic-party ... 
        It goes without saying that I disagree with @ezraklein on this.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/800833572001169408 ... 
        You can't just put out some policies on your website and say you're a populist.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/800835172048535552 ... 
        Populism is an approach to political economy in which suspicion of concentrations of power and monopoly are paramount.
        It is a very traditional American viewpoint in in which big business and finance are understood as political and not economic forces.
        HRC and Obama simply come from a different intellectual tradition. They see concentration as natural and apolitical, 'economics'.
        They want to find "the right answer" to a policy question, as if data and experts can lead to a solution.
        For populists, there is no economics, there is political economy. There are democratic ways of running commerce and undemocratic ways.
        Of course it is. It's delusional to think otherwise.https://twitter.com/WellingtonRandy/status/800874537172815873 ... 
        Correct. They just weren't really populist. She opposed Glass-Steagall for a reason.https://twitter.com/_silversmith/status/800884055457824769 ... 
        This is called regional inequality, and market concentration is the culprit. http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/11/15/Heres-How-Make-Electoral-College-Work-Again ... https://twitter.com/jimtankersley/status/801079245091049472 ...

        Is there any way to tell gcc to absolutely not use a register in a specific function?
        I guess I can just declare register int *foo asm("r12")  and then the compiler won't touch it? Any other way?
        I'm pretty sure that volatile is not the answer here btw
        Oh I see people are interpreting this as "Use memory, not a register" but what I meant was "I want this specific CPU register to go unused"
        So yes you are all actually entirely correct and I apologise for the confusion
        Ok having thought about this more what I actually want is for gcc to not use a specific register ever unless I hand-write assembler
        Any better way to do that than declaring a global register variable that's visible from every compilation unit?
        Ah! -ffixed-r15 should do it huzzah

        Oh, I see. It's a bunch of whiny college students who want a 'safe space' free from criticism of their hare-brained opinions.
        I suspect if the moderate-right folks don't step up and condemn the neo-nazis, they'll become identified with 'em.

        "Trump's Social Security point man called for privatization" by @kfile http://cnnmon.ie/2gf2atb  via @CNNMoney
        Now is a good time to read:
        How could Clinton have lost when her house organ Vox pumps out this kind of insight http://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/18/13678404/trump-ford-jobs-mexico ... pic.twitter.com/eMdvClr1na
        Still mystified that Clinton wasn't swept to victory by her base, woke hedge fund managers
        Trump's presidency will be corrupt on a scale not seen in America for 100 years if everhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-scramble-to-assess-the-dangers-of-president-elects-global-business-empire/2016/11/20/1bbdc2a2-ad18-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html?tid=ss_tw ... 
        The mainstream press is/will be incapable of pushing back against Trump & his people. If you are counting on them, you shouldn't.
        Btw, Trump's insane billionaire backer Robert Mercer probably funded the campaign illegally http://thebea.st/2fTfqWW  @woodruffbets
        If you have extra $$$ & want to do something that's unquestionably & immediately good, this is an excellent optionhttps://twitter.com/prisonculture/status/800801851432116224?lang=en ...
