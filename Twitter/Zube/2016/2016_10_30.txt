        What Clinton is going through is what everyone under investigation has always gone through. LE is perfectly happy to ruin innocent lives.
        LE is happy to leak your porn browsing history to the media, just to mess with your career. They prosecute first in the public eye.
        It is 100% normal for an investigator to selectively leak the parts of their work that make you seem super guilty. Comey is not weird.
        Watch the Clinton investigation and see if you would want rule 41 changed to allow hacking without limits on what they do with the info :)

        14. Economic inequality cannot be carved out from social or political sectors. Economic inequality IS political inequality.
        15. That was just not an ingredient in the salad bad in 2008. But it is now.
        16. You can look at this as a debate b/n Trump and Clinton. But there's another way to a see a deep split that is far more optimistic.
        17. Here the executives of Time Warner and AT&T are attacking both HRC/Kaine and Trump for opposing their merger. Now THAT is a debate.
        18. The oligarchs who concentrate power, quietly, are now speaking openly against our political class.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/792085834698719232 ... 
        19. The most remarkable reorganization of our culture these last few years is an insane merger boom.http://www.wsj.com/articles/merger-deals-set-monthly-record-even-as-election-looms-1477614934 ... 
        20. This is increasingly understood as a political phenomenon, a power grab by financial bosses looting our corporations.
        21. @ZephyrTeachout wants to debate, not just her political opponent, but her opponents superpac donors.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zephyr-teachout-paul-singer-debate_us_57b21d62e4b0718404126567 ... 
        22. What I found is that this is a longstanding American tradition. Big finance and democracy have often been seen as competitors.
        23. As our politics destabilizes b/c of the overwhelming chokehold monopolists and financiers have on our culture, this tradition returns.
        24. You may or may not like the people mixing the salad, but there are different ingredients available. Populist ones. Scary ones too.
        25. That was the point of writing about this tradition. I wrote about the Democrats and why it died in the 70s.http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/ ... 
        26. But there is a GOP tradition of this as well. Anti-monopoly, or commercial freedom, is a cornerstone of America.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novemberdecember-2016/how-to-make-conservatism-great-again/ ... 
        MA legislator Pat Jehlen did this already-debated DFER rep funding her opponent on Facebook https://dianeravitch.net/2016/09/08/great-news-pat-jehlen-beats-dfer-opponent-in-massachusetts/ ... https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/792381012772724737 ... 
        27. Ingredients changing. MA state Senator debates charter school hedge fund opponents instead of formal opponent.https://twitter.com/leoniehaimson/status/792382573070651393 ... 
        28. The millennial generation is big, populist, and wants democracy. They are young adults now. The salad bar ingredients are changing.
        29. These are the kids of the foreclosure crisis. Though some are individually greedy, they abhor greed as a social organizing principle.
        30. These are the people who will, who in fact are, reaching back into our great American traditions of protest, dissent, and populism.
        31. This is the generation that will, that is, restructuring our commercial society to be democratic once again.http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/ ...

        This mom spent 96 days in jail for no reason -- and no one is being held accountable for it, writes @BonnieKristianhttp://rare.us/story/this-mom-spent-96-days-in-jail-for-no-reason-and-no-one-is-being-held-accountable-for-it/ ... 
        Note to Comey: In news business, you wouldn't publish story so thin 10 days before election, w/o providing details.http://nyti.ms/2dUqCxl 
        At this point the best source of information is Podesta's request to "immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining."
        Podesta would not have said something *that* unequivocal unless he knew the emails were harmless.
        The Clinton campaign's request for more detail is either evidence the emails are harmless, or a huge gamble. And gamblers they are not.

        Republicans who say that @HillaryClinton is now "under FBI investigation" or that the FBI "re-opened" one ...  are lying. They are liars.
        The Programmers' Credo: we do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy
        "The next big step forward for DNSSEC" is obsolete NIST P-curve DSA. DNSSEC marches doggedly on towards 2003.
        It only took 17 years to get RSA-2048 on the calendar. With effort, we could have broken ECC DNS in as few as 10! ECDSA BY 2027!
        The TLS working group just stood up to the finance industry and said "fuck no, we won't include RSA in TLS 1.3, even if it breaks things."
        The DNS working groups operate in an alternate universe where cryptographic integrity doesn't matter.
        There's a reason for this:
        I wrote a piece in July on why Comey's public comments about Clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comeys-abuse-of-power/2016/07/06/7799d39e-4392-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html?utm_term=.e52be523a140 ... 
        Anthony Weiner's continued existence seems like proof that the Clintons don't actually go around killing people who pose a risk to them
