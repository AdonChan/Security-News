        It would do Apple well to third party kernel devs to not make their codesign verify routines opaque, so we can verify our own daemons.
        I understand why Apple hid most of their kernel to reduce attack surface, but if you're signing, let devs be devs and have the right tools.

        Dear women (and men) in #InfoSec, 
        If you want to discuss tech but think that #Infosec looks like an unapproachable old boys club, never hesitate to reach out. In my ...
        ... experience most so-called "old boys" are approachable and very willing to discuss ideas, no matter who you are. We all learnt from ...
        ... and grew up with green nicknames on dark screens.
        @halvarflake Infosec old hands are generally happy to talk to anybody.  Getting us to shut up again is the hard part.
        If you're in security and you want to actually be doing something, write malware and hack. Everyone else's just analyzes those guys' work
        @thegrugq @halvarflake not recommended. It's quite depressing when years pass and nobody writes about your malware bc is not even detected
        Being in the US reminds me how I truly have a complicated relationship to almost everything.
        And that talking about diversity in tech requires facing the uncomfortable truth that US high school system fails large chunks of society.

        2) collide. How were those bugs found? Are those bugs near other previously disclosed bug? And do bugs in other areas collide as often?

        To be fair, I'm not sure he was advocating shooting his opponent. He might have been advocating shooting her SCOTUS picks.
        I think it would be nearly politically impossible for the Sec Svc to arrest a candidate for even direct threats made against an opponent.
        Doubly true for an opposition candidate.
        No one ever threatens to bring out the 4th Amendment people.
        Trump is driving me to 21st Amendment remedies.

        I don't think it was a credible threat, since they don't make guns small enough for his fingers to reach the trigger.
        In all seriousness, I doubt Trump's 2nd Amnt comment broke the law, but it was horribly irresponsible. Lends legitimacy to assassination.

        To put it a different way, this is why our gov't and cultural institutions are having increasing trouble 'thinking'. http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/08/10/think-tanks-and-the-influence-of-corporate-dollars/government-has-gutted-its-independent-research ... 
        This is stunning.  And we wonder why the 1% is doing very well?pic.twitter.com/nO3PTIWUem
        Important new report out today, "Monopoly Power and the Decline of Small Business" by @stacyfmitchell https://ilsr.org/monopoly-power-and-the-decline-of-small-business/ ... 
        Fascinating anecdote. In North Dakota, pharmacies must be owned by pharmacists. Result: lower drug prices. https://ilsr.org/monopoly-power-and-the-decline-of-small-business/ ... 
        One unstated implication of this report is that monopoly/competition policy is far larger than antitrust. https://ilsr.org/monopoly-power-and-the-decline-of-small-business/ ... 
        In the case of the North Dakota pharma example, it's a state law requiring small scale ownership of a key industry. https://ilsr.org/monopoly-power-and-the-decline-of-small-business/ ... 
        "Between 1997 and 2012, the number of small manufacturers fell by more 70,000 & local retailers saw their ranks diminish by about 108,000."
        "Between 1997 and 2012, the number of small construction firms declined
        "The number of community banks and credit unions has likewise fallen, dropping from 26,000 to 13,000 since 1995." https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2016/08/MonopolyPower-SmallBusiness.pdf ... 
        Monopoly strangling small businesses is probably a key reason for the collapse of productivity. No incentive to deploy innovations.
        It's largely an anecdotal narrative, with a bit more data every day, because industrial organizational economics doesn't focus there.
        Once you see the trade-off b/n concentration and democracy you can't unsee it. It's everywhere. 
        This @matthewstoller history of growth and gutting of government policy research is essential for think-tank debates http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/08/10/think-tanks-and-the-influence-of-corporate-dollars/government-has-gutted-its-independent-research ... 
        Amazing example - local govt, small biz, and lower prices.  Better wages for employees too, I bet.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/763402158876217344 ... 
        Small business sentimentalism strikes again.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/763401630712602624 ... 
        Useful piece by @BruceBartlett from 2011, with more detail on what Gingrich did.http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/gingrich-and-the-destruction-of-congressional-expertise/?_r=0 ... 
        "The GAO budget has been cut by 13 percent in real terms since 1992  and its work force reduced by 40 percent -- more than 2,000 people."
        The GAO is essentially Congress's investigative arm, and produces enormous amounts of policy work.
        Often when you see an article on some policy controversy, it's because the GAO came out with a report on it.
        Another way excessive industry consolidation harms us: it saps diversity of ideas.Great analysis via @matthewstoller http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/08/10/think-tanks-and-the-influence-of-corporate-dollars/government-has-gutted-its-independent-research ...
