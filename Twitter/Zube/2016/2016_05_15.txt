        One of the hardest things in a profession is knowing what essential truths to sacrifice in pursuit of an explanation of your work and field.
        [1/4] Unlocking a website isn't like unlocking a computer. You are sending your key to the website, which they then use to try in a lock.
        [2/4] If a website gets hacked, hackers can copy ur key from server, or take apart lock to figure out what your key looks like, make a copy.
        [3/4] Both cases, you want to make sure your key doesn't work anywhere else. Don't give the valet your room key, just key only works in car.
        [4/4] Strength of real keys aren't the resiliency of the metal they made from or complexity, it's that all your locks use different designs.
        Public keys encryption is like multiplying your secret number by 2 and getting 8, with only recipient being able to figure out secret was 4.

        "Experience with putting a harmless app into the AppStore" will be an awesome talk :-)
        . @adamcaudill they are trying to kill it by stopping our customers from getting bugfixes. Like I say: AppStore is for bullying developers
        . @halston696 what do you think would be the media fallout for pulling a completely harmless Top1 security app just because of nonsense?

        Actually I just see that if you want to enter a review for an app there is the AppSupport button right next to it.
        Okay the AppSupport link is right in front of you when you review an app. So these reviewers are either ... or fakes.
        Actually I am waiting for someone writing a review saying: developer only has support page for Germany and UK bad app!
        . @p0peax prior to this app becoming famous we had 2 bugfixes that were reviewed in 6h and in 3h.
        So the English support website of our app now has descriptions for all tests: https://www.sektioneins.de/apps/sysinfo/support/en/description.html ... 
        Someone stole our app icon with our company logo and put it into the  AppStore
        So we are very sorry that Apple review keeps us in deliberate limbo and meanwhile lets fraudsters into the storehttps://appsto.re/de/7iB4ab.i 
        More material for my AppStore talk 
        So where/how do you issue a DMCA takedown notice against the AppStore?
        Apple is currently selling potentially malicious software with our company logo in the AppStore. What todo?https://appsto.re/de/7iB4ab.i 
        I submitted a content dispute claim against the potential malware distributed by Apple's AppStore with our company logo.
        . @qwertyoruiopz as you are not on the Apple shitlist you will be able todo so faster than our minor bugfix release 
        THIS.https://twitter.com/qwertyoruiopz/status/731440819140431873 ... 
        Keep in mind:guy stole our app icon most likely after our bugfix was in status IN REVIEW & his fraud app went through review faster than us
        THIShttps://twitter.com/pseudonym1x1/status/731443419734757376 ... 
        So who knows the original author of system monitor (the app that was stolen)? need to make him submit a content dispute, too.
        Looks like the original app is open sourcehttps://github.com/Asido/SystemMonitor ... 
        Does anyone have that Apple website url handy were they threat  devs that dragging AppStore disputes into public will have negative impact?
        According to @heiseonline @CrowdStrike , @PaloAltoNtwks and @cylanceinc are LITTLE AV firms... http://m.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Virus-Total-sperrt-kleinere-AV-Firmen-aus-3208080.html ... 
        Average review time for 14 May. iOS: 1 day, Mac: 1 day. http://appreviewtimes.com . Contribute with #iosreviewtime or #macreviewtime.
        . @appreviewtimes #iosreviewtime 5 days and still counting for "System and Security Info"
        @Dinosn Apple should have done this long time ago and natively! Thanks @i0n1c! 99c well deserved :)
        So you just need to take this: https://github.com/Asido/SystemMonitor ... , rip an icon off from app @i0n1c made, and release on official AppStore! 
        @i0n1c looks like this dev aims to copy stuff. He also has an app named 'SBSettings' with logo of original SBSettings. #AppleReviewFail
        I only now realized that my favorite moron @Morpheus______ is ranting against our tool for tweets and tweets.
        Btw @Morpheus______ just publicly claimed that there is a tool in the AppStore that can show the battery serial. But he won't give a link.
        @i0n1c It's made by the Chinese so it's probably malware, pretty stupid Apple lets this slide and not your update..pic.twitter.com/0dzDDncdbB
        I would not be surprised at all if @Morpheus______ sandbox talk that he submitted to @HITBGSEC is making heavy use of my code.
        And again "System and Security Info" calls only functions that are part of the public headers of the iOS  9.3 SDK.No private function called
        Download the App now!!!! Apple just called they are pulling the App.
        Hey @WilliamTurton Apple just called they are pulling the app because we show the process list.
        Apple claims us showing the process list to the user is a privacy violation (because YOU have no right to see the processes on YOUR device)
        And of course Apple waited with pulling the app until the media hype is over. They wanted media not to report about this.
        Of course now that Apple pulls our app I have to disclose full details how tracking apps users have installed is possible all the time.
        Apple will most likely only pull our app. That means the fraudster they let into the store will now sell a lot because people look for app!
        @i0n1c Just bought the app to show support to you and for users rights to know what is running on their device
        Always keep in mind:nothing in the App was hidden, even the description said it and it passed review.This is just Apple bullying developers.

        I just published "Who Are the Winners and Losers Following Google's Refusal to Carry Payday-Loan Advertising?"https://medium.com/@hilarybmiller/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-following-googles-refusal-to-carry-payday-loan-advertising-57e433364642#.ygkmbfqqi ... 
        Google (payday loan ads) and Facebook (conservative views) aren't willing to be neutral platforms. Yet both lobby FCC to make ISPs neutral.
        White House backs Google's set-top box proposal. In return, Google bans payday ads, targeted by White House (CFPB).pic.twitter.com/lmyxiq1xzg
        It's time to break up Google, folks. The power it has over commerce and policy is dangerous. Search should be split from content to start.
        Then search should be broken into regional divisions a la the Baby Bells: Search West, Search East, Search North, Search South.
        If Google can impose its (twisted) values of what can & can't appear on its platform, then Google picks the winners & losers of the economy.
        Can you imagine how much hell would rain down on Comcast if it blocked its subscribers access to payday lenders' websites? 
        this is the best of the Trump comparative analyses i've read (including my own)
        Getting ideologically sympathetic monopolists to voluntarily ban ads from a particular industry is a very weird way to govern
        The reality that Facebook and Google have power and thus public obligations is now dawning on the rest of the business world.
        What Google and Facebook are doing is governing. They are not competitive businesses, they are de facto mini-governments.
        Revolutionary-era Americans would have understood this implicitly. The Revolution in many ways was a rebellion against corporate power.
        Hamilton's financial apparatus was organized to vest government powers in elite hands. That is what a bank and corporate charter was/is.
        There were multiple rebellions against this agenda even after the Revolution. Shays, Pennsylvania Regulation, Fries - all across the country
        Prior to the revolution, the elite gentry sided with the working class against British corporate power. After, the gentry flipped.
        The language of competition policy - antitrust, regulation - comes from this fight over political liberties and corporate power.
        The Whiskey rebellion is also known as the War of Pennsylvania Regulation. The rebels called themselves 'regulators'.
        They believed they had the right to defend themselves against the unjust enrichment of speculators just as they had against the British.
        The Pennsylvania Regulators wanted paper money, public land banks, and regulation of finance. Basically the New Deal.
        Anyway the gentry only sided with the working class when threatened by other powerful gentry or foreign powers.
        It's fascinating to watch various elites grab what are essentially 18th and 19th century working class concepts to defend their interests.
        @matthewstoller This is an interesting question. Woody Holton see it as a flip. I think the alliance was always almost solely tactical.
        It's kind of shocking that virtually no one has heard of the war of the regulation and the various regulator wars of the late 18th century.

        Worse, trying to support gui products is an endlessly irritating task.
        Because I can give someone a command to run in a CLI without issue, but telling them to click on the third blue element on the left? Oy.
        Your products, if you're at all successful, -will- be used by non-english speakers.
        And none of y'all realize that design language differs across cultural barriers.
        Which just makes my life all the harder, and makes me have to think harder about how to communicate these concepts.
        Not to mention - yes, I see y'all in my mentions and I agree - CLI interfaces let me chain output to other things.
        So I can do my own processing to figure it out instead of relying on your "clever" visualizations.
        If your product won't support my 80x25 monochrome console, I will resent you for it.
        I don't want a fancy attack map. I want a table with clear delimiters so I can get meaningful intel out of the data into iptables.
        I don't want modal popups for details. I want a JSON object or similar that I can cut the relevant parts out of.
        I don't want a friendly editor to build filters. I want a flat-ASCII configuration file so I can build 'em in any way I choose.
        Get your WIMP interfaces out of my way and let me get some WORK done.

        I'm as fond of linking together big incidents as anyone, but I don't see anything credible about this:pic.twitter.com/Pd4PseFEsK
        There's been nothing to back up these allegations anywhere that I've read thus far. All we have is BAE's word for it.
        There's no independent corroboration; there's no sources I've seen that don't trace back to Reuters' article; there's nothing.
        And I've yet to see any IOCs released that would allow third parties to evaluate whether these alleged threats are in their systems.
        Honestly, all it says is that the tools may have possibly used a common library.
        And the 'connection' is -very- tenuous - a couple typos, a common dev environment, and a couple functions.https://twitter.com/bond_alexander/status/731265472482541570 ... 
        I've got a pretty decent guess as to why they might use Visual C++ 6, and it rhymes with "croftware fierates".
        Looking at http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html ...  the attribution links they're giving are:
        First, "has typos" is so unbelievably weak a link as to be entirely specious. The strings exhibiting typos aren't even the same ones.
        Second, Visual C++ 6 is just a dev environment, and one which is pretty old and widely available. How much is developed in it?
        Third, "has file wipe and file delete capability"? Wouldn't those be necessary for the desired functions? Form follows function here.
        I just don't see these attributions as being credible links. I think it's a case of wishful thinking - of rose colored glasses - etc.
        Sure, it'd be cool if it were the same actor who hit sony! That'd be neat! Ooh, conspiracy!
