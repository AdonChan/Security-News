        We have entered an era of purely tactical politics where apparently short term gains cloud all other judgement.
        At this point what is left for the UK Parliament is an attempt at proving you can get "a bit pregnant" by somehow ignoring the referendum.
        In all of this UK mess my greatest dread is a return of The Troubles sparked by the leave/remain divide.
        OK, calling it: the smart plan will be not to invoke Article 50 and repeat the referendum after a snap General Election. And kick Juncker.

        Yes, UK is out. But EU will never lose Ukraine. It's five extra, rainey letters as a bonus.
        Yes, a bit of a problem for EU elites: a referendum on any other subject would be safely ignored or repeated until the right results were in
        The real speculation today is not around the pound but around FR-exit, IT-exit, NL-exit, ES-exit domain names. DE-exit -- probably not.
