        I wonder why the iOS sandbox omits certain sandbox checks if code is signed by Blizzard Entertainment Inc.
        Actually the OS X sandbox makes the same exception for Blizzard
        Just #GameThingspic.twitter.com/vaWN80iUsp
        Luckily we all know that Blizzard Games never have remote vulnerabilities 
        I just verified: the magic sandbox teamidentifier is actually the current one used for Blizzard games in the iOS app store.
        . @yanni4100 it looks like if you are signed by blizzard you can execute whatever executables you find on an iOS device
        The FBI should release more iOS games
        For those late to the party: the sandbox bypass exception for Blizzard only affects the access() family of syscalls - probably harmless
