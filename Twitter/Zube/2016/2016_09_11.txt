        20gbps ddos on my site this afternoon. guess that's what happens when you expose a ddos for hire service http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/ ... 
        I'm still amazed at how little attention this vDOS story has gotten. these clowns are the 800 lb gorillas. people need to care more.
        actually make that 128Gpbs. shit just got real.
        word from three sources now that vDOS proprietor AppleJ4ck just got raided in Israel. guess that explains a lot.
        The ISPs of the world need to take a deep, hard look at the hosting providers and resellers who are facilitating IP spoofing.
        Unless that happens, nothing will change. I hope to be a part of shining a light on who needs to get a clue.  Expect that soon.
        .@briankrebs Yes please take the BCP38 torch I have been carrying for decade!
        ISPs that don't block spoofed packets are a national security threat, plain and simple. Whose security threatened may change day to day...
        ....but failing to treat this like a national/intl' security issue is to let terror win. and make no mistake; that's what we're dealing w/
        sorry, but the only thing that will get anyone's attention is pure reputation-based isolation 4 ISPs/hosters that don't take this seriously.
        Couching this as a BGP problem is a cop-out. Everyone knows that BGP is fundamentally broken. Reputation-based routing is different.
        Naming and shaming works. Always has, always will. The data has to be there. Will any providers stand by it is the question.
        Reputation based routing is like this: Want to continue to let assholes run the Internet? no problem. just wait more than everyone else.
        hoping to get @CloudFlare to host this enormous vDOS attack log file. Gotten ridiculous # of ISPs ask for it today. Stay tuned.
        Cloudflare has graciously arranged to host the vDOS attack log, which is pretty large as text files go https://www.cloudflare.com/media/krebs/attacks.txt.zip ...
