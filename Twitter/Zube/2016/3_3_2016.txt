        Congratulations to Whit Diffie and Marty Hellman on their (long overdue) Turing Award! http://www.acm.org/awards/2015-turing ... 
        Diffie and Hellman's paper showed me how cryptography could be not just interesting, but mind-blowingly surprising.
        @mattblaze It's so overdue that at first I thought it was a rerun announcement--I was certain they'd won it a long time ago.
        Today's SSL vulnerabilities are our reminder that we're perfectly capable of breaking our own protocols even without law enforcement's help.
        @mattblaze well, technically it was with law enforcements help (aka export ciphers)
        Is it just me or are the audio levels on the crypto hearing stream really uneven and often low?
        I hope the people who do actual wiretaps are better at setting audio levels than the people streaming this hearing.
        I think we can all agree that Trump had us all going there for a while. Good one, Donald! Now let's start with the actual candidates, OK?
        Periodic reminder: This is about much more than a particular vendor's ability to unlock a particular model phone in a particular case.
        Really proud that @ACLU has taken such a strong position on importance of software updates. https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_apple_amicus_brief.pdf ...  pic.twitter.com/e8zhvK1tfG
        This may be the year of the political "nondorsement": Not endorsing any candidate, but making clear NOT to vote for a particular one.

        Trump's speech was mostly about trade policy and globalization.
        Donald Trump says he's gotten thousands of letters from women who have been helped by Planned Parenthood
        Scary thing about Trump: Trade deficit is big problem; infrastructure is behind; tax avoidance is shameful. This resonates
        What we need right now is a smug political scientist explaining why none of this can really happen.
        He's already sanding off the rough edges,  moderating the tone, and focusing on economic populism. Watch out, people.

        Spent 2 hours thinking I'd entirely misunderstood how Go slices work, and it turns out the kernel is handing me different garbage per read
        One of those days where it could be the kernel or it could be the firmware and I don't actually know which is easier to deal with
        Hey this might actually be a kernel bug and crap I think I'd rather deal with the firmware
        Debugging be dding directly out of /dev/mem
        Turns out IBM broke the kernel in 4.4 and it's been gaslighting me ever since
        Oh. My Bluetooth works better if I move the test machine closer to the light.
        Does http://pastebin.com/K1D5zBaS  ring a bell for anyone? It's an RGBâ†’LED protocol mapping, wondering if it's custom or some sort of standard
        Remember! Not everybody who would suffer under an oppressive regime has the financial or legal ability to flee the country.
        When you talk about heading to Canada, you're telling those who can't that you value your comfort more than their safety
        It might still be a justifiable choice! But it's one of those choices that has consequences that you might not consider, and you should
        (Obviously if you are personally at risk in staying, you should definitely leave if you are able to!)
        Warning do not look at LED light strip with remaining visual system
        Well yup that's one set of weird Bluetooth lights working
        I have the best coworkers: https://github.com/mischief/efivim 
        I posted just a quick update about the @FSF, #Linux, #ZFS, and the #GPL: https://u.fsf.org/1oa 
        The backend code for this light controller is a hastily rewritten heart beat monitor implementation
        Which makes sense given where Bluetooth LE started out, but even so
        This LED controller scales red and blue to values from 2 to 2088, but leaves green as 0 to 255. People who understand this stuff: ideas?
        Setting red or blue to 0 confuses it until a power cycle, but happy to write that off as bonghits

        And user-chosen passwords and password reuse are -still- vastly larger threat surfaces, even with this bad practice.
        So, here's a notion: DNS greylisting.
        If they fast-flux, they're blacklisted and flagged for administrative review.
        This may have the potential to handle a lot of phishing and malware attempts, especially if the greylist redirects to a local notice page.
        Will have to figure out how to implement this.

        Note that this week's SSL DROWN vulnerability in Internet encryption is because of encryption backdoors the US government forced in the 90s.
        The weaknesses that government backdoors in encryption forced in 90s and we are dealing with today aren't even the weaknesses they intended.
