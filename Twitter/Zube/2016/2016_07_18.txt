        Listening to the academic teams detailed approach is very different from our jump in and go crazy approach.  They're smart!
        Also I love how they wrote GUI tools :).pic.twitter.com/fH0N0ETomO
        Also their tool did everything you'd ever need, but everyone keeps writing new tools :)
        Their tool was circa 2010.
        On their road tests, I knew they used safety gear, but they had police supervision (and waivers) as well!
        I've read their papers 10 times so it's interesting to pick up little tidbits I didn't know.

        @SwiftOnSecurity @manfightdragon eat the fraud while waiting for certification, which means banks/Visa are in no hurry at all.
        I guess I don't understand why merchants have any involvement in processing the payment. Why don't terminals just SSH to the card processor?

        All those commenting on Turkey - A backround in turkish history and deeper understanding on Politics would be necessary. Understanding ..1/2
