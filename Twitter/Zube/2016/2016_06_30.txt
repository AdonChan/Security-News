        PSA: A third-party audit is no substitute for not running your complex code at high privilege levels. It wasn't in 2005, and isn't in 2015.
        I have heard former and current AV executives go like "oh yeah we will have the code audited". Bullshit. Get it sandboxed and lowprived.
        Yes, that may mean you have to spend money on engineering instead of marketing.
        There are a gazillion ways of sandboxing your code. Chrome Sandbox, NaCL/zerovm, virtualization, qemu. No excuses.
        I would be more cordial and less aggro on the subject if I hadn't seen AV companies plop 250k+ for trade show booths, spend many millions..
        .. on marketing, but flinch at the suggestion of hiring 2 FTEs to sandbox and improve their product and protect their customers.
        And these problems are not news - everybody knows since the mid-2ks that the AVs are all broken.

        Finally, since you're not keeping anything on the system, you'll want to communicate (using a -very- restricted grammar) to a backend.
        So fixed-format messages are your friend here - and if it's corrupted in transit, reject it. 
        It's usually "accept liberally; send conservatively"
        If you reject a transaction for being corrupted, that's better than allowing the possibility of parser corruption ;-)
        I'd -like- to see a POS grammar built with LANGSEC principles, but I don't know of any yet.
        At any rate - the overall gist is to strip away all but the utterly necessary functionality, and limit even that.
        By doing this, you can limit your attack surfaces very significantly, and make your systems much safer.
        We had at least moved past "just opening a bad email/page can infect your computer". Antivirus got us back there. https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/how-to-compromise-enterprise-endpoint.html ...
