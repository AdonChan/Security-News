        ICYMI: NAND "Mirroring" Concept Demonstration http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=6015 
        Theologians agree many of the Bible stories are allegorical (arguably even Genesis); the resurrection is however fiercely believed historic.
        This is the core of Christianity, in spite of many who've abused "God" as an excuse to hate and kill. Remember that. https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/713976368447365121 ... 
        This may be the first time I've worn pants in a year.
        This article demonstrates how little Soghoian actually knows about the forensics industry. http://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/shadowy-hacking-industry-may-help-fbi-crack-terrorist-s-iphone/article_f718bfad-3e58-574f-8567-92e5e9b68bcd.html ... 
        I don't like Cellebrite, but they're hardly a "shadowy hacking industry", Chris. They're well respected and their capabilities are public.
        Anyone can take a UFED and reverse engineer it to see what Cellebrite does. Most code is not secret sauce, but industry standard stuff.
        But wait. That uses encryption. Isn't that evil? https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs/status/713677273426034688 ...

        Forensics companies are generally not stockpiling vulnerabilities; they recycle vulns already patched or exploits/jailbreaks in the wild.
        On average, any original code used in a LE forensic tool is reverse engineered and reused by someone else within 3-6 months. Hardly secret.
        It's been years since I've seen anything original come out of any forensics company for iPhone. If ever.
