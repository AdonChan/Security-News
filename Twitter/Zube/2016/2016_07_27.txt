        I think the point @snowden was trying to make is that we need better threat intelligence. Problem is you can't have that without collection.
        You can't do targeted collection as you have to compromise a host to know if they're American. So they do bulk collection for threat intel.
        Not saying bulk collection (domestic spying) is right, but it's the only way to have good threat intelligence. You can't have it both ways.
        So if we want the US to stop spying, we need to be willing to concede that we don't need as good threat intelligence as we have.
        Today, our level of threat intelligence greatly exceeds our competence at interpreting it; too much intel is just as bad as no intel.

        2/  The cyber-attack on Iranian nuclear centrifuges was one of the most consequential in history.
        3/ USG openly & aggressively supports technologies that weaken foreign governments' control over their networks.
        5/ These are but some of many reasons why the USG is widely viewed as most aggressive nation for cyber ops.
        6/ It's also well known that US has in past used covert ops to influence foreign elections.
        8/ The difference w the Russian DNC op, if true, is that Kremlin published the stolen data.  Otherwise it's ordinary state espionage.
        11/ The point is that USG plays rough in cyberspace, and should expect others to do so as well.
        12/  And yet USG seems perpetually unprepared. DNC hack is tiny tip of iceberg of possible electoral disruptions via cyber.

        If only the Dems had a candidate with high personal popularity, no criminal liabilities, and an invigorating policy platform to nominate.

        Putin isn't hurting Clinton because he likes Trump's plans--that's too unpredictable.  But chaos in the West works in his favor.

        We're living in a weird dystopian future where being bad at email is considered roughly as bad as being an obviously megalomanical fascist.
        I'm not delighted with either of the two major party candidates, but they're not even remotely "equivalent." Grow up.
        Can't share our data here, but I will say that this week's encrypted + clear P25 traffic is an amazing exercise in traffic analysis.
        (Basically, so much metadata leaks in P25 encrypted traffic, that even a small amount of clear content reveals a LOT, in the aggregate.
        Heh. Only the *counter-protesters* seem to have shown up for the Westboro Baptist protest in Philly.

        Both parties are running against free trade, the bipartisan foundation of post-war peace and yes, prosperity.https://twitter.com/scottwongdc/status/757777738266804225 ... 
        Because both parties are too scared to tell people anything other than the simple tales they want to hear.
        So many annoying political critiques come down to essentially, 'Tut tut, manners'.
        I just don't get it. There are many well-mannered sadistic people. There are many loud and rude people who are loyal and kind.
        Polite people are more likely to hurt others. Contrarians are more likely to refuse to hurt others even when orderedhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-green-mind/201406/are-polite-people-more-violent-and-destructive ... 
        Slaves built the White House. And during the war of 1812, ex-slaves freed by the British helped burn the WH down.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-1814-burning-of-washington-d-c/ ... 
        The War of 1812 is such a formative and important war, little studied or acknowledged. Helped create Canada and the U.S.
        In 1812, the southern cotton boom and a newer more toxic industrial slavery was just being established. Confederate ideology forming.
        This could be seen as a response to Hamilton's destructive 1790s attack on democracy and his entrenchment of oligarchy.
        In 1791, Hamilton's predicting that American cotton will die out. In 1793, cotton gin invented. 1790s is the dot com boom of U.S. cotton.
        Southerners distrustful but dependent on British credit, goods, and textile mills. Plantations rather than yeoman farmers emerge.
        In 1790s, Virginia is a moderate state. War of 1812 pushes Virginia away from the union and towards the South.
        By the 1820s the ideology changed from 'slavery is a necessary evil' to 'slavery is the natural and right order'.
        Jacksonian Democrats eventually split into slave power supporters and anti-slavery labor supporters.
        America in 1820s-1830s is far more racist than America in 1790s.
        Big business is Big Cotton. But Martin Van Buren, who opposes slavery, still runs with Andrew Jackson.
        In 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution grants all men the vote, no formal restrictions on free African-American men. By 1790 this changes.
        1790 Hamiltonian-influenced PA Constitution makes property franchise requirements, but no color barrier. Disenfranchises nearly everyone.
        1830s new state Constitution allows all white men to vote, regardless of property. Color barrier explicit. Free black residents protest.
        Remember, the most important issue of 2016 is who shows better manners. Chin up. Posture.

        DNC Leak Shows Mechanics of a Slanted Campaign - Rolling Stonehttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/dnc-leak-shows-mechanics-of-a-slanted-campaign-w430814 ... 
        I just wrote a gigantic feature ripping Trump that ran three days ago. https://twitter.com/zachlange/status/757760850450972673 ... 
        Politico did a great job on this subject back in May. It was a story for a while.https://twitter.com/fayevars/status/757766611872931840 ... 
        More on the subject of my #DNCleak piece yesterday, from the Politico reporters who originally covered the storyhttp://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-leak-clinton-team-deflected-state-cash-concerns-226191 ... 
        Again, our take on the DNC reacting to the Hillary Victory Fund story:http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/dnc-leak-shows-mechanics-of-a-slanted-campaign-w430814 ... 
        Politico really wasn't in on the fix. People misunderstand what that "agreement" was about.https://twitter.com/pro_aktv/status/757920267901476864 ... 
        If Politico was really "colluding" with the DNC they wouldn't have written such an aggressive piece at all.https://twitter.com/lgtechnodrome/status/757929646008573952 ... 
        Huh? Those Politico reporters hit the DNC hard before the leaks - and with original reporting, not rhetoric.https://twitter.com/verycosmic/status/757938927646810112 ... 
        You know nothing about this business. Read Vogel/Arnsdorf's original story. Does that read like DNC-approved copy?https://twitter.com/shayand2/status/757955956252692480 ... 
        I've never sent a whole text, but you give story targets chances to respond to all serious charges for a reason.https://twitter.com/dguisinger/status/757960802854772736 ... 
        One, it's only fair. Two, you're protecting yourself, by learning where they think you're factually wrong.https://twitter.com/dguisinger/status/757960802854772736 ... 
        That may be true. Just not in this case.https://twitter.com/dguisinger/status/757963136402018304 ... 
        This affected millions of longtime faithful Democratic voters. Were they "interlopers," too? https://twitter.com/may_2112/status/757967628421902336 ...

        Looks like @MalwareJake
        *history class in the year 2100* 
        @munin I wrote another new presentation since then that I gave at SANS Denver and yet another new preso at @BSidesLV and @dcskytalks
        This is a good thread on the issues w/ presentation of numbers for the simulations in FiveThirtyEight modelhttps://twitter.com/zeynep/status/757984567030525952 ... 
        For a comparison, the burn area of the #SandFire is very nearly the size of Washington, DC. http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/4878/ 
        Significantly less harm to the country as a whole, though ;-)
        I get asked "why doesn't china blow us up" re: open scada on the net
        .@Viss Yep. "You don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs" is -proverbial-
        Judge Rakoff prohibits @uber from using any information derived from pretense investigation in class action:http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/nyregion/investigation-of-conservationist-conducted-on-ubers-behalf-crossed-the-line-judge-rules.html ... 
        This is your reminder that attribution is a political act, and it really doesn't matter -who- broke in so much as -how-.
        So finger pointing to Russia or no, the real question is by whom the various quasi-gov't party systems are owned. Or pwned.
        Because, as much as I loathe partisan politics, the reality is that those persons on those systems have significant influence in gov't ops.
        It doesn't matter if the http://senate.gov  servers are completely secure if you can get to all the senators via their party accounts.
        So perhaps stop faffing about over the obvious distraction of this guccifer copycat and AUDIT THE PARTIES.
        And yes - ALL of them. Are you really that naive that you think the DNC is the only one "hacked" here?
        You must use humor as a defense mechanism.
        Why is it still a thing where b2b businesses still take unencrypted credit card information by email in pdf forms and they think it's "okay"

        Tinfoil hat theory of the day: /1 Russia involved in Turkish coup, disinformation campaign to weaken NATO southern front.
        /2 DNC hack part of campaign to disrupt US politics, with Trump more sympathetic to Russia, less committed to NATO.
        /3 Turkish coup and crackdown takes second largest military in NATO off the field.
        /4 Watch Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova.
        /5 also, stand by for an August, September, and October Surprise.
        Another one bites the dust from Ars Deathwatch 2016http://arstechnica.com/?post_type=post&p=799625 ... 
        /6 none of this would have been possible if HRC, the DNC, and others had not clicked those links, ignored opec.
        I tell you, the plot of the Democratic Primary looks more like "The Crying Game" every minute.
