        Even when C89 was being drafted, there was a concern for ensuring that compilers could optimize based on non-aliasing assumptions.

        With footnote 28 as follows: "The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an object may or may not be aliased."

        If you are an enemy of the state and trusted a middleman under duress of the state you have already failed. Security isn't musical chairs./2
        Frequency-hopping is a valid conceptual technique, except in tech you eventually run out of 3rd party infrastructure and code to trust./3
        Warrant canaries inform public debate on breadth of squelching of speech and compelled action of 3rd parties, are not a security layer/4/end

        On a train that just violated a stop signal and was 15 feet from derailing when it finally stopped. Suspect we'll be here a while.
        Train almost ran into a switch that was aligned against it.
        Everyone 's fine. Train was moving slowly when it finally stopped. But we'll be sitting here a while
        Train just got permission to back up and proceed to the next station, where, I presume, the engineer will take early retirement.
        Someone on this train just said "we'll just promote it with a hackathon" which makes me want to get back on the train that almost derailed.
        One normally wouldn't expect "Saddam Hussein was a great leader" to be part of a stump speech, but the world is full of surprises lately.
        Sure, having to pick the lesser evil sucks. But you know what's good about it? You end up with a lesser evil that you otherwise would.
        When will we finally say "enough"?

        In general I'm pro police not having guns but the PSNI have them and don't murder people so the real problem may be actually be US police
        Taking away their guns won't make them any less racist or any more subject to the law and minorities will continue to suffer

        @CiPHPerCoder I tell people XSS is attacking users by abusing their trust they have in the app so social eng., drive-by-downloads, ads work

        Argh. Now I'm architecting behaviors for elevator controllers to maintain complex ACLs but still allow safe egress.
        This elevator issue of @samkottler has entirely nerd sniped me.
        OK, so your overall access control system will need some kind of database, but shouldn't expose it over the network - that's dumb.
        Instead, have the endpoints take the credential on the token and pack it with the access point number, and send that to an auth server.
        For the elevator's purpose, each floor counts as a separate access point - select floor, scan token, request made.
        Return code will be either granted, denied, or timeout, which will auth the routine to go to that floor.
        And there should be a specific default case to allow travel from any floor to the lobby, because of safety.
        That one should not require a token to be scanned, because we want people to be able to egress.
        You'll also want a man trap at each elevator lobby to handle tailgaters, but that's physec design, not elevator arch ;-)
        So this arch -should- fail safe - if there's an error condition at the ACL db, then you can't go -in- but you can leave.
        Further, this means you can swap out databases so long as they expose the proper auth API.
        I'm sure there's an edge case or two that I haven't figured out, but this feels good enough to implement. Nerd snipe done. ;-)

        University degrees do very little to prepare most people for most jobs, white collar or not. Is free tuition the best answer to mobility?
        There's a chart somewhere mapping undergrad to postgrad degrees. Is the English degree really helping all those lawyers?
        Russian Lit is, I'm sure, a fantastically interesting major. Did it really make you a better litigator?
        Even if universities are 100% free, they will still be more accessible to middle/upper class students who can take 4 years off from work.
        They'll also remain more accessible to people brought up in stable families and have their academic shit together at age 18.
        I'unno about you, but I had all the advantages you could reasonably ask for and I was a basket case at 18.
