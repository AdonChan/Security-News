        If Trump wins, no one will be more surprised than him.
        Trump supporters and opponents think he's the one they've awaited (with hope and fear respectively) but he just thinks it's been a fun ride.
        That's a critical (and fortunate) difference between Trump and Hitler. Hitler agreed with his supporters. Trump's just using his.

        Hey @rootkovska Microsoft has taken some ideas from Qubes OS http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/windows-10-will-soon-run-edge-in-a-virtual-machine-to-keep-you-safe/ ... 
        This article focuses on *isolation* aspect, while I bet the biggest challenge has been *integration*. E.g. how is GPU exposed to VM?https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/780995210620862464 ... 
        Also I don't take credit for the idea of using virtualization for isolation. If anything then for desktop *integration* over (isolated) VMs.
