        I haven't checked yet, but I suspect execute only pages are going to play a big role in preventing DRM removal / piracy in iOS 10.
        Interesting fact mentioned at BH, effaceable storage does not permit wear leveling, to avoid duplicating keys in NAND block 0.
        Creepy thought: iOS tries to guess the last time you log into your device for the day. If you're sick, it's calculating your time of death.
        If there's a vulnerability in a Cloud Key Vault fleet, it sounds like users are going to be stuck on a vulnerable platform for a while.

        The new @united security question hit the rare sweet spot of being hard to remember, low entropy, and annoying. Nice work!
        Also, thanks to @united's security Q's, I can no longer discuss art, music, movies, vegetables, or ice cream flavors publicly.
        I'm glad they didn't ask things like "what's your favorite NP-complete problem".
        I can't get to my @united account because I worry about what my answer about the flipped-over turtle in the desert says about me.
        Everyone: believe it or not, you are not the first person to think of the idea of using made-up answers to security questions. I got it.
        Assuming that NSA "Equation Group" trove is real, I guess thats one way to audit the Vulnerabilities Equities Process...

        Examples of  "simpler problems" include: banking, slot machines, aerospace, etc. Elections are *very* hard, many requirements.
        And now people are telling me how easy this e-voting stuff should be.  Please don't quit your day job (unless it involves software).
        Seriously: before publicly declaring how easy this (long studied, universally-recognized-to-be-difficult) problem is, maybe google it first.

        People often forget the main goal for a security project should be to resist attacks, rather than... having fun together when making it.
        This should not be interpreted as a defense for Jake. But it's disturbing to watch how this affair erodes the Tor community.
        FWIW, Jake tried his manipulative/harassing exploits on me too. I shrugged them. As an infosec veteran, I might be a bit tougher target ;)

        I think password manager fanaticism might be even worse than video game fanaticism.
        It's tough to get security appliances to audit, many vendors blacklist me (seriously). If you work for a vendor & want to help, let me know.
        FireEye is the only major vendor who has helped and responded positively to vulnerability reports, kudos to them.
        Scary. Ban researchers so nobody knows how dangerous the appliance is, but keep on shipping that thing to customers.https://twitter.com/aragogando/status/765972946762534912 ... 
        @taviso Scary: the cost of one unit and risk of losing face is too much for an otherwise free security audit by world's #1 hackers.

        Trump is bringing someone who openly works with Putin's propaganda channel Russia Today to get his first classified intel briefing. Amazing.
        In Montreal, they still have working phone booths and there's a skyscraper with a"Yellow Pages" sign on it.

        I can't get to my @united account because I worry about what my answer about the flipped-over turtle in the desert says about me.
        If you're going to tell me "Equation Group" uses lots of RC5 and RC6, please also tell me in what modes.
        I'd like to know if they're just idiosyncratic, or also incompetent.
        Equation Group being bad at crypto isn't an idle question; speaks to attribution. Are we to assume NSA is also incompetent w/ basic crypto?
        Let's all take a moment to wish Paul Manafort good luck with his polonium poisoning.
        It is truly alarming that anybody out there still believes in the "many eyes makes bugs shallow" theory.https://twitter.com/SteveBellovin/status/765949881810882564 ... 
        What percentage of bug bounty reports are for vulns that no "black market" anywhere buys? Opening bid: 98%.
        "Here's Hillary in-a fancy chair, with a pillow that probably cost more than your first car."
        I have no trouble believing that HeatStreet followers tend to drive $30 cars.
        @tqbf I'd bet on 99% assuming that was the limit of decimal places allowed.
        Basically: don't pay attention to any reporting, esp. attribution reporting, that is about cryptography.https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/765970024322531328 ...
