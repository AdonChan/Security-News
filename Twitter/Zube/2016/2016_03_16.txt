        More important than the current Apple case is the issue of whether vendors will remain free to design products without deliberate backdoors.
        @mattblaze And the govt said, "You have to use sticks, so only we can get in." and the last surviving little pig said, "Wait. What?"

        @ddayen I think FVA is useful as concept, silly as budgeting tool. I also think you have an unhealthy obsession with my thoughts.
        @MikeGrunwald So it's not worth updating a major piece that laundered a lot of ideas about FVA, most of which GAO just knocked down?
