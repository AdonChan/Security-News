        One of my least frequently asked questions, but worth saying: You should never have a production server in your house.
        Tonight is streaming night. I'm going to follow on from the last Linux ROP session, and show how to make the exploit work universally.
        I'll be assuming that you've seen the previous session https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmawM1EXnM ...  and so you know the context. Diving straight back into ROP.
        I'll show my lame approach to scanning remote memory through (what was I calling) double-buffered ROP chains. Hope to see ya there!
        I've bought http://thecolonial.tv  but haven't set it up yet. Hence, you'll have to continue going here instead:https://www.twitch.tv/th3colon1al

        Y'know what?
        Get some eminent domain action going on.
        Because the existence of his name on a big building is a direct invitation to terrorists.
        Too big a risk for the city; have to condemn it as a safety hazard for the millions who live and work there.
        If he won't divest himself, then every city that hosts his properties should do it for him.
        He obviously won't do the right thing, so in the interests of the country, we have to do the right thing -for- him.
        .@joshcorman So you're saying that BMW can deliberately trap persons inside a vehicle remotely? That's a fun new ransomware.
        So according to this, we have a means of trapping people in vehicles remotely. New ransomware opportunity.https://twitter.com/bfbcping/status/806128086022549506 ... 
        Oh, hey, new kind of SWATting too - activate the 'thief' lock and tell cops that the occupant is armed and dangerous.
        In what -conceivable- fashion is this a good idea?
        @munin It's almost like designers should maybe start taking the question, "what's the worst that could happen?" more seriously or something.
        Ok, teleconference people? 
        The dynamic range gets mangled; the choice of tunes is always dreadful; and even if you try to be funny, it never turns out well.
        Either put in a recitation of epic poetry or use a non-offensive [QUIET] beep to indicate the line is active but not currently up.

        4 of 10 americans would go celibate for a year if it meant that they would not have to worry about getting hacked #passwords16pic.twitter.com/pxFhnITAkC
        A reasonable statistics given that most probably do involuntary celibacy for a year some time in their life anyway. #passwords16

        "It depends" is "no" for my purposes. Thanks!
        Fair! Selling COTS to a USG that happens to be doing this doesn't count. But selling COTS on a PO SPECIFICALLY ABOUT mass deportation does.https://twitter.com/vathpela/status/805995624650915841 ... 
        "Helped without knowing" doesn't count.
        Yup. This.https://twitter.com/BurritoAlPastor/status/806005263287209984 ... 
        Dan Gackle and Scott Bell aren't declaring a moratorium on politics on HN out of some secret status-quo-preserving agenda.
        They're doing it because they spend an increasing amount of their time beating back (primarily alt-right) trolls and defusing fights.
        If you have spent the last several years declaring to Twitter what a shitshow HN is, and not engaging on HN itself, maybe shut up.
        I've spent years trying my best not to let misogynists, racists, and other clowns have the last word on HN. 
        When its over, maybe some of you who have such strong opinions about HN moderation can rejoin the site and help push back on foul comments.
        Politics off HN for a week doesn't mean "no politics anywhere" and I'm still interested in your responses to this:https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/805994769243586560 ...

        "Fakenews" doesn't mean mistaken or even fatally biased news. It means knowingly, deliberately falsified news.https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/806193072723939328 ... 
        I love Filippo but that post is kind of silly. People who rarely NEED encrypted messages tend to hate PGP.
        PGP is an extremely simple (and clunky!) tool that people are constantly trying to make do too much.
        Crypto researchers _LOVE_ to hate on PGP, both because it's an archaic design they can't kill, and because they want to design "PGPng".

        Many companies match charitable donations by their employees. Have you used up your matching funds for 2016 yet?
        Remember that if places are de-funded for being sanctuary cities, there will be a huge funding shortfall. It's a good time to give locally
