        The Zengge ones are sold under a large number of brands, so especially interested in compatibility reports
        Reported this to upstream 8 months ago without response, so: libupnp's default behaviour allows anyone to write to your filesystem
        Seriously. Find a device running a libupnp based server (Shodan says there's rather a lot), and POST a file to /testfile. Then GET /testfile
        ... and yeah if the server is running as root (it is) and is using / as the web root (probably not, but maybe) this gives full host fs access
        @mjg59 they should have just used a regular expression obvs
        One especially fun thing is that you can usually overwrite the device descriptor XML which means you can trigger client bugs as well
        Summary: It's Monday, everything's fucked, no change here
        Anyway, patch is here:https://github.com/mjg59/pupnp-code/commit/be0a01bdb83395d9f3a5ea09c1308a4f1a972cbd ...

        Further update:pic.twitter.com/Kpbz0Cu24J
        The Intel TSS2 stack seems better than the IBM one in every meaningful way (like, say, having public RCS) but is still terrible
        Like, say, having all client/daemon communication go over IP so it has no idea whether the request comes from the same user who loaded a key
        The reason nobody uses TPMs is that almost literally everything above the hardware is bullshit, which doesn't give faith in the hardware
