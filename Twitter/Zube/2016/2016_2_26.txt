        Tor users actively discriminated against by the tech community that knows better than to trust a third of the people on Tor.

        Media is talking about Tor users like they're a protected class, or were born with Tor and can't help being on a network known for abuse.
        Tor is a useful tool. It has some good uses. More bad ones. Admins have a right, and are even wise to evaluate traffic based on its origins.

        Cabal mailing list is borked following #OpenBSD upgrade where mailman now wants _smtpd instead of daemon and I run Sendmail!
        This is clearly part of a French colonialist/ageist strategy by @PoolpOrg to force OpenSMTP upon the Sendmail Republican Army.
        Today Matthew Craig of Shapiro Arato & I filed a technologists' amicus brief in the 4th Cir. case Wikimedia v. NSA: https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2016/02/technologists-brief-wikimedia-v-nsa ... 
        I think @PoolpOrg's server has just won a microcode "upgrade"...  one which detects OpenSMPTD running and inserts random crashes.
        It can only be disabled by running OpenSMTPD as daemon and recompiling the Mailman port --with-gid=daemon.
        We will not stop until OpenSMTPD configuration files are in APL and it supports masquerading!
        OK, I am moderately miffed that I do have to recompile the Mailman port to make it work with Sendmail instead of OpenSMTP on #OpenBSD 5.8.

        Future of European Data Protection - if you store ip addresses the new law will apply to you.
        Future of European Data Protection - DPO will be accountable and sanctions could be applied
        Future of European Data Protection - DPO will have to demonstrate and document the privacy by design and by default
        Future of European Data Protection - DPO will have to participate to the design of the systems in order to guarantee privacy of the data
        Future of European Data Protection - impact analysis is mandatory, usage of ISO 27005 recommended
        Future of European Data Protection - Transmission, Processing and Storage Policy will be mandatory
        Future of European Data Protection - outsourcing companies are also accountable and need to designate a DPO
        Future of European Data Protection - outsourcing of DPO role is possible. New market opportunities for consulting companies
        Future of European Data Protection - DPO will have 72 hours to notify the national data protection authority in case of privacy breach
        Future of European Data Protection - portability of data must be free of charge. Aligned with PSD2
        Future of European Data Protection - sanctions 4% of the world wide yearly revenue of the company or 20 millions of euro
        Future of European Data Protection - do you understand better why Apple don't want to implement backdoors:) 4% is enough

        We may have reached the point where the cost of compromising them is in excess of 1m though. Small steps in the right direction.

        Apple developing new security measures to make it harder to comply with future court orders. Logical countermove. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/technology/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-an-iphone-even-it-cant-hack.html ... 
        TIL: the "emergency notification alert" sound simultaneously going off on all three of my cellphones scares the bejesus out of me.
        Also there's a flash flood warning in Philly right now.
        Actually, my first thought was "I'm glad I'm not in the quiet car."
        Prediction: Next step in the ad-blocker-blocker wars will be tracker-blocker-blockers. This will get uglier before it gets better.
        That said, as long as browsers run on general computers, the ad-blockers should be able to win an escalating arms rase.

        The assumption must always be that if it's technically possible for a company to be compelled to betray you, it'll happen.
        No matter how trustworthy the company at present. No matter how good their PR. If the law ever changes, they'll leak your secrets.
        @mjg59 No one is going to to jail to protect my privacy. Most won't even risk a bad quarterly result. Or bad PR. Or a stern talking to.

        I mean it *doesn't* explain why this fake mac is trusted rather than what's in the packet header
        But I can come up with at least three explanations all of which are awful
        Most of them start "OH WHAT THE FUCK ANDROID HOW DO WE MAKE THIS WORK"
        Protip if you thought process starts "OH WHAT THE FUCK ANDROID" go and have a drink and come back later when less angry

        We also may need a rule for Kasich doing a "Well, excuse me for being sane"-type speech.
        This should be the official campaign toast, like "Prost": say "Christie was a federal prosecutor" before drinking. https://twitter.com/brianinhd/status/702865201587163137 ...

        Microsoft knows that if Apple loses, MS will also get FISA requests for "push out malicious update to customers" https://twitter.com/dinabass/status/702909887341158400 ... 
        So let's have a little thought experiment on what might happen if this were the case. https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/702924757931429888 ... 
        First thing's first: -massive- loss of trust for vendor updates, resulting in significantly slower time-to-install. Malware would love it.
        Probably quite a bit of push to overseas-mediated Unices, like Suse - can't trust the US-based ones, after all.
        More positively, perhaps a push for an independent patch-vetting organization - a neutral third party to evaluate patches for safety.
        Which'd be a measure for self-preservation for those of us who care about security.
        @munin Binary transparency and "am I seeing the same update as everyone else"  is probably next security frontier.
        @munin I already did:
        .@zmanian I think this would be a valuable thing even if the FBI loses - being able to validate binaries is somewhere we need development.

        My Apple Watch just told me I'd achieved my goal of 30 minutes exercise while I was sitting on the bog.
        I highly recommend Talk Talk's 1986 album 'The Colour of Spring'. Not a duff track on it.
        Albums I wouldn't recommend: Chris Rea's ill-fated 'Four Fingers Up The Pope'.
        I've probably posted this before, but this live version of Renee by Talk Talk is extremely lovely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQrDASKEbc ... 
        My Talk Talk binges always lead me to 'Watershed' by Mark Hollis, one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0yeE_XtUKU ... 
        I bought an out-of-date packet of chocolate digestives and it was full of dead kittens.

        With OpenSSL security releases it's basically: everything is on fire (critical severity) or nobody cares (high severity).
        Kudos to OpenSSL team for adding "critical" severity to http://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html ...  It helps. Previously, "high" covered too wide a range.

        Post-Gandalf Cryptography.
        Developers have LOTS of arguments against standardizing interviews. They're allergic to process; standardizing requires leap of faith.
        You should ignore your dev team's qualms about standardizing interviews. They are wrong. You need to standardize and iterate.
        You may assume a standard interview will miss promising outliers. The OPPOSITE is true: they are like ground-penetrating radar for talent.
        A standardized interview gives people with no experience and no resume permission to apply and CREDIBLY DEMONSTRATE APTITUDE.
        Informal, ad-hoc, free-form, Q&A structured interviews simply can't do this. They aren't credible and lean heavily on shared background.
        Both interviewer and candidate are terrified. Neither does well. Interviewer will rarely take a flyer on candidate with no resume.
