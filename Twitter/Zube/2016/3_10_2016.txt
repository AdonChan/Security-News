        Got my copy of the car hackers handbook.  Excited to give it a read. pic.twitter.com/Dqs1ZCb4YK
        I'm a little confused that The Car Hackers Handbook doesn't mention me, @nudehaberdasher, or more importantly, @supersat
        Damn, @SummerC0n is looking great this year: http://www.summercon.com

        Good info in the protocol section.  The tools chapter uses open source Linux tools.  I prefer mine built on ecom cables for Windows.

        America knows cyber! pic.twitter.com/U8R4ZnSfLS
        Another way to look at it is 25% of Americans still know about our research.  That's 100x more than ever knew about my NFC research.
        Here's another thing that 1 in 4 Americans know about http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/14/277058739/1-in-4-americans-think-the-sun-goes-around-the-earth-survey-says ... 
        I'm impressed 1 in 4 ever knew about the jeep hack.  Usually only my grandma and @nudehaberdasher's little brother knows about my research.
        Dang that article said at one point 72% of people heard of the research.  Time to quit researching!
        People remember @a_greenberg crying on the highway but don't forget we worked with Chrysler for nine months previous to that.
        Funny how stuff doesn't get fixed for nine months then is fixed within a week of a "stunt hack"

        21 USC Â§676 & 9 CFR Â§317.8(b)(2) make it a crime to sell lard as "farm style" or "country style," unless it was rendered in an open kettle.

        @SteveBellovin they've doubled their output, that is efficient!

        Cortana gestured to the distant din of the city. "Of all the humans, of all the minds. I inquire yours. You never question this?"
        Jake looked at Cortana, hands resting on the railing. "There are others. Others you accompany."
        They stood together on a rooftop illuminated by Cortana's electric blue. "Why me," Jake asked.

        You know who nobody says "didn't seem confident enough"? The one who yelled at them about hash table collisions.
        If they say hash table is O(1) lookup, say it's O(n). If they say O(n), O(1). This isn't science: it's status hierarchy. BE ALPHA DORK.

        Along with International Women's Day the UN also observes days for forests, jazz, yoga, hepatitis, tourism, statistics, soil and toilets.
        What I'm saying is, the UN is probably lending the same weight to International Women's Day as it is International Mountain Day (11th Dec).

        Can HN commenters make a moral issue out of whether you do shallow or full git clones? Yes, they can.
        Interviewing tip: if asked to compare sorting algorithms, say: "I almost never sort anything. I consider it a sign of weakness."
        They'll look at you funny or like you're crazy or laugh. Then say, "no, I mean it. If I have unsorted data to sort, I shoulda used a tree".
        22 years into this software career I finally feel qualified to tell you that sorting is really not all that important.
        Second interviewing recommendation: if they ask you Big-O questions, pick a fight with them over hash table worst vs. average case.
        If they say hash table is O(1) lookup, say it's O(n). If they say O(n), O(1). This isn't science: it's status hierarchy. BE ALPHA DORK.
        You know who nobody says "didn't seem confident enough"? The one who yelled at them about hash table collisions.
        also like number three tip find biggest interviewer in the yard and punch them in the nose? 
        The thing about sorting, BTW? I meant it. Are you people sorting things all the time? Why am I never sorting?
        @tqbf I usually shank the first one between the ribs and leave them lying there while the others and I finish out the interview. #culturefit

        Time to start packing for some fun @nullcon

        e.g. "drying" mode? literally just cooling mode with fan forced to low speed. that's it.
        an aircon's operation is defined by two variables: instantaneous power transfer (scalar) and instantaneous airflow (vector). that's it.
        it's interesting because you can pay 2x for controls all else being same and it'll be worth power savings alone. e.g. presence sensing.
