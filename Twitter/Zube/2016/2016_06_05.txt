        High profile figures are able to get away with things because they're in a position to make a significant proportion of accusations go away
        If you're a victim and you talk, there's a significant risk that nobody will believe you and you'll be remembered for "false accusations"
        If there's a real risk of harm to you and that nothing will happen to them, it's hardly irrational to warn friends but not the public
        We don't fix this by telling people to speak out more. We fix it by making it safe for them to speak out.
