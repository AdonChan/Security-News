        Craig Wright is NOT #SatoshiNakamoto. He just reused a publicly available signature with block 9 key. Sign "CW is Satoshi" if you can!
        The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is 100% irrelevant to the success of Bitcoin and blockchain tech. Why do we always seek for a hero/villain?

        Aye, a fingerprint and a separate access PIN (different from passcode) would solve this problemhttps://twitter.com/matthewstinar/status/726940732951564288 ... 
        Two months ago, I sent a feature request to allow the user to have an 8 hour fingerprint bio timeout. Courts usually don't move that fast.
        If you're worried about no-knock warrants in the middle of the night, reboot your phone before bed. Shuts off the fingerprint reader.
        Not sure if I should be offended .gov is ordering a fingerprint or impressed they didn't shut the phone down and ruin the evidence again.
        Court can order you to give your fingerprint but can they order you to tell them which finger it's trained on? Wrong finger shuts it off.

        Satoshi signed a transaction in 2009. Wright copied that specific signature and tried to pass it off as new.  OpenSSL bugs interfered.

        Super useful Google trick when searching for math definitions: include the word "intuition".
        It's monthly HN hiring thread day. If you're a hiring manager unfamiliar with it: the HN hiring thread can be _really_ effective.
        Hiring thread tips: GOOD job ads say something interesting about the company, SELL the job to candidates, are SPECIFIC and DETAILED.
        BAD job ads on the hiring thread have LISTS OF REQUIREMENTS (never ever, not even a little) or assume candidates will research your company.
        DO NOT use your hiring thread post to qualify candidates. Do lead qualification ELSEWHERE in your hiring pipeline. Leave requirements out!
        The best benefits to cite in selling a job on HN are about the ROLE, not the company perks. Perks are fine, but ROLE matters most.
        You're not "hiring Clojure developers". You're offering an opportunity to do <interesting thing> using Clojure.
        Translate all phrases in the form "we're looking for X" to the form "you get to do X". Then re-evaluate to make X sound cooler.
        Want to impress the shit out of everyone on the hiring thread? DESCRIBE YOUR HIRING PROCESS IN DEPTH.
        Describing your hiring process in a job ad gives more people PERMISSION TO APPLY that they would not ordinarily grant themselves.

        Weren't doing all these job ad thing before? Starting today? Thank me later for saving you tens of thousands of dollars.
        The making of a great job ad is a very subtle art. Many do's and don't's. So for this one I'm thinking...  thinking... 
        @raesene @tqbf @mroytman those spikes roughly correlate with our scans at Michigan. We stopped scanning FREAK over summer 2015.
        As mayor of the altered state of Drugachusetts I hereby revoke your privilege not to understand isogeny Diffie-Hellman.

        A film crew is getting B-roll footage of me on a computer right now, so I'm typing this to pretend like I'm doing something important.
