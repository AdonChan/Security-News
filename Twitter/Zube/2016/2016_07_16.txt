        The mistake people make on social media is assuming that if you make your opinion known, that you want to argue about it with them.
        Free advice: If you can't stand someone's opinions so much that you can't just ignore them (like I do daily), then just unfollow them.
        "Social" media is like "society"; you don't start arguments with strangers you overhear on the street, or interrupt to pontificate.
        The biggest mistake social networking ever made was opening it to the public.

        If the Nice attack was a true lone wolf armed with nothing but a 19-ton lorry, it is an insanely difficult attack to defend against.
        You can track & disrupt networks of people, or track & disrupt acquisition of arms/explosives. Possibly this attack had neither.
        Who came up with the 'innovation' of indiscriminate targeting of civilians in terrorism, historically?

        It seems almost trite to call the senseless, cruel attack in Nice an unspeakable horror, but there aren't words for this.
        Lots of bad computer science jokes no one will get about whether TrumpPence is call by name or call by value.
        @mattblaze sorry Matt, but that joke's not Wirth repeating.

        After a couple of quiet weeks, I'm back into scheduling guests for the @syscast_online podcast. If you've got recommendations, shoot!
        With the attack in Nice, terrorists have learned you don't need bombs or guns to cause a lot of damage. A truck will do.
        This makes it much easier to actually *do* such an attack. Guns & bombs are hard to come by, but every-day objects? Well shit.
