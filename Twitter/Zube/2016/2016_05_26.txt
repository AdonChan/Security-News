        Starting a dogpile is the perfect form of harassment. You know your followers will do the dirty work for you and fault can't be "proven."
        But make no mistake: people who do this repeatedly, knowing their followers harass and threaten, know exactly what they're doing.
        You can always claim you did nothing wrong. "I can't control what my followers do" - oh but you forgot about all the other times?

        Oh btw guys we removed the jailbreak detection from our app and resubmitted it for review. App is in review for several days already.
        What secure messenger is there that has a desktop client? (And is not controlled by an USA entity?)
        I forgot important requirement: secure group chats
        Linkedin stock up 2.74%. Their ad traffic is going through the roof, as everyone needs to log in to change their password.
        So we removed the processlist and the jailbreak detection and Apple continues to reject our app.
        This time we get rejected because we write in our app description the features we had to remove.
        I guess we just proved beyond reasonable doubt that rejection of our app is just bullying by Apple and has nothing todo with the App.
        . @pmichelli we do not have to beat Apple.Them publicly demonstrating how they treat security researchers for disclosing vulns is win enough
        . @iMokhles why should we not inform people who are looking for the jailbreak detection or processlist that the app no longer contains them
        Apple claims it is not relevant to know for customers that our app no longer contains specific features that were available before.
        . @allthetimefore of course it is. Apple is just unreasonable as usual.

        So when a forced upgrade breaks your system, there is zero liability on the part of the vendor.
        It's your problem - they can just shrug and tell you to buy a 'compatible' system.
        This is wrong.
        If a vendor is going to force upgrades on you, then they must accept liability for the changes they are making without your consent.
        Forced upgrades are a -very- different dynamic than being able to test and accept or deny updates depending on whether they work properly.
        You can't have it both ways, vendors.
        And in either case, make it -perfectly- clear to the buyer -before- they buy what the conditions are.

        Cryptocurrencies are religions: everything they say is a lie and nothing works, and that just makes the faithful more zealous.
        Lisk's Ubuntu instructions make no sense; they think there's no sudo group https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/PrereqSetup#linux ...

        My previous contempt towards cryptocurrencies was uninformed. Now I understand them better: they deserve far more contempt.

        If cryptocurrencies were a game, I wouldn't mind, but it's cruel to take investors' money and be a bunch of incompetent liars.
        Gridcoin seems like the only cryptocurrency that makes any sense, but apparently it will take several days to sync and let me start
        I got 83% of the Gridcoin blockchain from  https://www.reddit.com/r/gridcoin/comments/457dtr/wallet_wont_download_blocksconnect/ ...  :)
        Wow, I heard that Lisk price crashed because users can easily steal one another's passwords https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1484108.0 ... 
        "LISK is massive scam ... crashing ... The devs can't even run a webpage for gods sake. Get out now." https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1484096.0 ... 
        Lisk victims and other cryptocurrency "investors": please report them to the FTC https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/paying-bitcoins ... 
        With my 83% jumpstart, it will take only 30 hours for my Gridcoin wallet to synchronize.
        LISK launched at .015 Bitcoin, and fell to .0015 within hours https://yobit.net/en/trade/LISK/BTC ... 
        IOU trading places Lisk as third largest cryptocurrency with $250 mln market caphttp://www.econotimes.com/IOU-trading-places-Lisk-as-third-largest-cryptocurrency-with-$250-mln-market-cap-211929 ... 
        So Lisk just caused $250 million to evaporate in a few hours. And it was obvious trash. Did the founders pocket it & run?
        If your dog died & your house burned down, cheer up!  At least you didn't buy Lisk!

        The devastating vulnerability used by Conficker was detected first through Windows 7 crash telemetry. They saw the storm coming and prepared
        Google detected carrier-level malware injection in Southeast Asia through their Android telemetry, and brought it to light.
        Microsoft's tone-deaf communication with customers over Windows 10 has been particularly egregious - just ask any of their employees.
        Microsoft's narrative problem with Windows 10 and telemetry is a narrative they gleefully built themselves in clueless posts and obfuscation
        But Microsoft's problems with the enthusiast community shouldn't negate the incredible benefits that Win10 legitimately brings over Win7.
        Think of the user tricked into running an EXE that looks like a PDF, who loses his college work. Win10 SmartScreen would have prevented it.
        Some "Windows 10 Telemetry Removers" are overreaching fever dreams of people inspired by misunderstanding, turning off stuff like antivirus!
        Don't sentence users to the consequences of not having every available protection. Infections hurt people in ways you'll never experience.
        CORRECTION: @tziegmann pointed out this timeline is wrong. The crash logs were from Windows XP. I apologize.https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/johnla/2015/09/26/the-inside-story-behind-ms08-067/ ...

        BBC News - Norway consumer body stages live app terms readinghttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36378215 ... 
        .@SwiftOnSecurity @josephfcox Discussed that many years ago here in Norway. Conclusion? Customers would ask their bank "how do I update?"
        .@SwiftOnSecurity @josephfcox Which would essentially turn bank cust.service into a "free" computer help desk. Imminent chaos.
        Addressing attacks that scale with defenses that don't is a good recipe to do more harm than good. E.g. password advice, raising awareness.

        What is the current sane answer for collecting lots of log files efficiently and having some sort of searchable dashboard?
        It can't really be ELK, can it?
        ELK would be fine except I'm not putting a JVM on all my log-generating nodes.
        Cloudwatch was just way too easy not to do.
