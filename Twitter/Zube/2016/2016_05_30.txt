        Today is 29th of May
        The only reason why people go to /r/jailbreak is to watch kids getting conned into believing in fake jailbreaks.
        Apparently there is a Foxtel app in the App Store that not only has a jb detection but also a broken one that locks out users without jb
        @thegrugq Don't forget about NextGen AV!pic.twitter.com/qadLyGpKQF
        So that GSMagic team claims @qwertyoruiopz faked his jailbreakme video and then they put out their own "proof" video
        Some people believe that showing a video of a jailbreak allows apple to fix it in the next version. 
        Also some people think I believe to be superior to Apple engineers. Criticizing flaws has nothing to be with thinking to be superior...
        Twitter is using your phones camera to catch facial expressions. They analyze which tweets are frowned upon and which are funny.
        I read that PayPal app in the AppStore checks for injected libraries and if they find substrate kill the process?
        Kids on /r/jailbreak not amused i am tweeting about themhttps://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4ljg3o/news_proof_latest_jailbreak_ios_933_13g12_iphone/d3nvzq9 ... 
        . @drwdal most important apps have jailbreak detection in the Apple App Store it is only forbidden when Apple needs an argument to kill you
        I think @miaubz is living proof that markov bots can become real people.
        The next iOS kernel exploitation training will likely be in October in Frankfurt (in process of booking hotel)
        When the average wait time for everything (Doctor, bulky waste, furniture delivery) is one month it seems everything is understuffed.
        Germany is going to test section control to make more money from speedster.
        Nobody ever said that tomorrow 30th May 2016 there will be a jailbreak release, yet people believe deeply in it.
        Remain steadfast in the journey of faith, with firm hope in the Lord. This is the secret of our journey!
        Add to my todo list: tool that calcs has from file between offset x and y or from x with size z

        The problem with change is that it makes things different than they are.

        I just read the lyrics to  La Marseillaise. Wow that is a violent song. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Marseillaise ... 
        Biggest shock moving from China to Silicon Valley was how US PR teams at tech companies retaliated in the same way as Chinese officials.
        A VC said this but it could've been the PRC: "They wanted to be taken seriously as journalists, yet they didn't follow all the norms."
        This sounds like China too: "'Click bait journalists need to be taught lessons,' said the billionaire Vinod Khosla."
        Approaching many major tech companies for information is like approaching a Chinese government ministry.
        And boy do they hold grudges! One tech PR hack came up to me 3 YEARS after I wrote something. Like China's cadres who never forget.
        I've worked in the Bay Area for the last 2 years but if you've noticed, have rarely covered tech. That was a choice to avoid bulls***.
        Stonewalled for 5 years in China, I opted not to deal with more stonewalling, this time from American tech companies. It's a disgrace.
        Not joking when I say I see real parallels between tech companies and my experience with China's Communist cadres.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/736394836941676544 ...
