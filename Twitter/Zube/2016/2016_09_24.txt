        It's looking likely that KrebsOnSecurity will be offline for a while. Akamai's kicking me off their network tonight.
        Also, it seems clear that whoever built this ddos cannon has been testing it (in europe at OVH, in South America on Tuesday, elsewhere)
        i can't really fault Akamai for their decision. I likely cost them a ton of money today.
        So long everyone. It's been real.
        This is what I was talking about earlier. http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1599694 ...  zero sense of urgency to the ddos problem.
        Before everyone beats up on Akamai/Prolexic too much, they were providing me service pro bono. So, as I said, I don't fault them at all.

        Sorry, but if you have a Yahoo account, you will need to find a new mother, and have grown up on a different street.
        Password (& security Q) reuse means that data breaches on the scale of Yahoo are the security equivalent of ecological disasters.
        I wrote this thing for the @FTC blog last summer on security questions: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/advanced-password-tips-and-tricks ... https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/779117609891409927 ...

        Seriously ex-FTC official Alden Abbot is sputtering mad at the 'troubling' notion of fairness in antitrust.https://truthonthemarket.com/2016/09/22/acting-aags-policy-speech-sends-the-wrong-signals-on-antitrust-enforcement-or-a-wild-ride-back-to-the-fifties-and-sixties/ ... 
        I'll back up for a sec on antitrust. What's incredibly difficult to understand is just how antitrust law has been warped beyond recognition.
        Normal people think, oh, if there's a monopoly the company is using power badly, that's illegal. Lots of complaints on Epipen for instance.
        But since the 1970s antitrust lawyers - the antitrust bar - and their economist pets have reinvented antitrust as existing without morality.
        They made up a language that is totally un-American. They argued that fairness and morality and competition have no place in antitrust.
        Anyone who thinks that is a gasp - populist - and kills economic vitality. Even though post-1980 growth/productivity is lower than pre-1980.
        Their argument is completely crazy. It's madness. It's led to a financial crisis, catastrophic losses in jobs, small business collapse, etc.
        It's couched in terms like 'efficiency, consumer welfare, etc' & they seem like reasonable bureaucrats aghast at bad policy. It's madness.
        Here's one consequence, which is the actual possible collapse of American society due to supply chain shocks.https://www.thenation.com/article/how-america-could-collapse/ ... 
        People have *no idea* how fragile our supply chains really are. And this is a recent problem. It's hard to describe how dangerous it is.
        But to most of us, this revolution has worked out like this.
        An entire profession of antitrust lawyers and economist is on hand to explain why there is nothing that can or should be done.
        Why financiers that organize monopolies are doing so for efficiency sake, why Mylan's control of Epipen is good for society somehow.
        That's what this has come to. An ex-FTC official complaining that someone in government thinks fairness and morality should matter.
        Anti-monopoly is a political and moral movement about democracy. And the movement who inspired this piece is over.https://truthonthemarket.com/2016/09/22/acting-aags-policy-speech-sends-the-wrong-signals-on-antitrust-enforcement-or-a-wild-ride-back-to-the-fifties-and-sixties/ ... 
        @matthewstoller debates around food security vs food sovereignty capture thishttps://globalfoodpolitics.wordpress.com/2012/11/30/food-security-vs-food-sovereignty/ ... 
        Last thing - there are many who think anti-monopoly collapsed in the 1970s because of big money. I don't. It was an intellectual change.
        People changed their minds, in both parties, in business, labor, academia. A bit of corruption, there always is. But it was intellectual.

        Leverage existing TCP connections for other things, and modulate, say, the URG or NS flags to transmit information.

        Dear Lockheed: considering what happened this week, I can't even.pic.twitter.com/rTGLxtkQmM
        So...my question is, which is worse? Some h4x0r stealing 200m of your users' account data, or a "state actor" stealing 500m users' data?
        2) Because if I can say "oooh evil state actors coming after us", that makes it...more palatable? Right? Because APT uber-hax! #yahoobreach
        3) Whereas, if it's some standard cybercriminal finding a weakness in my network and doing a smash and grab...egg on face #yahoobreach
        4) So Yahoo is in the middle of a multibillion acquisition by Verizon, and they find out during the audit they've had a breach. #blamechina
        5) I don't conspiracy theorize. Much.

        Okay, I get that people feel the Clinton e-mail stuff has been given too much political weight. Compared to Trump's dickery, I agree. /1
        /2 But really, if you're going to call my reporting on the technical details a "crock of shit" because it hurts your feelings, you've lost.
        /3 Because while the issue has been overblow--the whole Benghazi thing has been a witch hunt--you can't whitewash that Clinton's people f'd up
        /4 I don't expect Clinton to understand email or State classification rules. I do expect her staff to. And to say "no" when it's required.
        Post coming shortly: that WH contractor's e-mail, like others, was exposed in a 3-year old Adobe breach. Taking bets on password reuse.

        Sounds plausible. Transition period? Live production testing? Devops intern? Lack of coffee & cpu/gpu cracking knowledge?
        But in this day & age to entirely forget about the existence of password cracking software seems really, really regrettable. #applehash
