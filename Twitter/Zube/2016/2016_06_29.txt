        Hey @kjhealy, is there a good synopsis of past attempts at rational utopianism? People ask for examples and I'd love to read a real article
        @baconmeteor @kjhealy https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153 ...  is one popular starting point
        @baconmeteor Scott's "Seeing like a State" is good on rational planning. Jennings' "Paradise Now" is a new book on American utopianism ...
        @baconmeteor ... Fred Turner's "From Counterculture to Cyberculture" is the story of how American Utopianism went digital ...
        @baconmeteor ... Philip Mirowsk's "Cyborg Dreams" covers some of it, but is mostly about Economics.
        @chulu @baconmeteor @kjhealy I highly recommend "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace"

        Hypothesis: whether Europe will continue to speak English depends on CIA's translation budget, not UK politics
        Silicon Valley is, on average, 20 years late in marketing neoliberal trends and toolkits. The trick is to always do it under new names.
        Serious question: are there any examples of actual non-neoliberals complaining about the non-existence of neoliberals?

        One of the best things about Twitter are replies from people who think @SCOTUSblog is run by the US Supreme Court.
        Fun fact: the most junior justice is usually assigned to run the @SCOTUSblog account, replying to concerned citizens and explaining rulings.
        Also, that last tweet was not true.  @SCOTUSblog
        Any other Philly RF geeks see a white Jeep SUV w/ what looked like an R&S DF radome around Ctr City last week? Anyone know what it was?
        I saw it twice driving around center city & university city. Regular PA tags, no special markings, almost definitely an R&S mobile DF setup.

        Ok I have disabled battery optimization for Twitter on Android but I *still* only get notifications when I move my phone and doze goes off
        The same's happening for Signal - I sometimes only get notifications when something else also triggers a notification, or when I touch it
        Can someone please explain to me what's going on here and how to fix it? Android 6.0.1 on a Nexus 6.

        I mean if people actually *are* marking reviews unhelpful because they didn't do a security analysis, don't - that's a super dick move.
        The *#*#426#*#* stats say that I haven't had any bad heartbeats
        Ok so it looks like it is just doze - all default priority notifications will be delayed regardless of app battery optimisation state
        So, different question. Is there any way for me to indicate that I actually do want immediate notifications for certain apps?

        Oh @usbank your password policy is frustrating. I give up. If @LastPass can't generate one in the first 3 tries, something is very wrong.

        To anyone in the EU who is reading this, I would like to apologise for Nigel Farage and everything he has ever said or done. He is a twat.
        I was hoping the feeling of "what the fuck have we done?" would have died down by now, but it's only getting stronger.
        There must be a contingency for rescuing a country when it's this badly fucked and seems intent only on becoming more fucked.
        Q: How many racists does it take to change a light bulb? A: Is it a British light bulb?
        Thankfully the EU parliament knows Farage is a turd. Unfortunately lots of people still in the EU might think he speaks for the country.
        He doesn't. He speaks for the misplaced arrogance of some British people, still believing the country is deserving of special treatment.
        Our national motto might as well be "two world wars and one world cup", because there are people still clinging to that.
        In reality, Britain is just a country. Better than some, worse than most, deserving of nothing.
        The EU made us part of something, and people like Boris and Farage can't stand that we're equal to and not better than the alliance.
        If you think we've taken control of our country and can live with Farage's blokey black shirt bollocks, you're the problem now.
        And if you think abusing POC is making Britain great again you are the worst kind of moron, the sort with the misplaced arrogance. Fuck you.
        I'm feeling great warmth towards the Scottish Parliament right now.
        I'm not sure why anyone is surprised that the people announcing an intention to stand for leader of the tories are hypergalactic megashites.
        If you've just passed a motion of no confidence, see your GP.
        The most practical thing to do now is leave Jeremy sitting in his office and go and set up a feasible opposition party somewhere else.
        At this point Tim Farron could strip naked and crap on the steps of parliament and it would the lighthearted story at the end of the news.
        After everything that they've done, how can the tories still have the only functioning major political party in England?
        Farage has no power. There is no reason to listen to him. He's just some gobby racist rubber-faced cunt and somehow he's fucked us all.
        The UN confirms that the British government's austerity programme is in breach of its human rights obligations. http://www.centreforwelfarereform.org/news/uk-in-breachhuman-rights/00287.html#.V3K7_vdCfwx.facebook ... 
        I have that nebulous connection with Turkey that people who've visited a country have. I'm no more knowledgeable but pay more attention.
