        Some thoughts on UIC TBB Selfrando paper: the threat model covers de-anonymization through code reuse, not 'de-anonymization'
        An arbitrary read can likely de-anonymize a tor user without code reuse. And a good memory disclosure is often reusable. Not all oob read
        Selfrando seems useful but not novel. I think microsoft (?) patented something similar awhile back and JITs do this naturally in code gen

        Our opponents are fueled by a feeling-- hatred of prices. No evidence or economics will turn them around. Their hatred of ISPs is secondary.

        Exactly. About 30 major banks were caught in overdraft-fee scams in recent years, including JPM, BoA, etc. https://twitter.com/dailyrotation/status/744625081465241601 ... 
        In Chase's case it was a $110m settlement. BOA was $410m, Union Bank $35m etc. Not all admitted wrongdoing.https://twitter.com/nightclubgenius/status/744636536919031808 ... 
        Not always, but yes, big parts of many settlements were tax deductible.https://twitter.com/mottdewitt/status/744659732422524928 ...

        Bloody experts, knowing stuff. Bastards.
        McDonald's Player Escorts are high class call girls wearing clown make-up. #euro2016
        Imagine being so arrogant as to spend years becoming knowledgeable about a subject and then giving an informed opinion. Experts. #traitors
        Of course, Michael Gove is asking us to listen to him when he says we shouldn't listen to experts. So... 
        ... By giving us his expert opinion is he saying we shouldn't listen to him or is he saying we should listen to him because he's not an expert?
        Because if he's not an expert and he's telling us to not listen to experts, then we shouldn't listen to him.
        We should only listen to experts telling us to not listen to experts, because they know what they're talking about.
        If an expert tells me I shouldn't listen to him because he's talking shit, then I'm inclined to believe him because he's an expert.
        But if Michael Gove tells me I shouldn't listen to experts and he's not an expert on experts, then there's no reason to take him seriously.
        What I'm saying is, Michael Gove is a cunt.
        The Leave campaign's slogan could literally be "Don't listen to intelligent people who know things, listen to us."
        There it is. I said "literally". I used "literally" in a sentence. I'm literally going to go and blow my own head off.
