        I wonder which politician will set the record for most flips on endorsing Trump. There should be a Golden Waffle award for them
        Talk to your children about the 2016 election before they hear about it on the streets
        The biggest political question of 2017 is whether the house will impeach Hillary Clinton on Inauguration Day, or wait a day or two
        Presumably they'll work out a compromise where Hillary is not removed from office, and serves her term from Federal prison

        @cynicalsecurity @veorq It's quite relevant to CopperheadOS because people have iOS contacts. Hoping that this all turns out well...

        Has the Trump campaign weighed in ALL ALL on risotto cooking technique? I hope this  comes up at the debate.
        In an ordinary election, the GOP nominee criticizing the Dem nominee for being secretly for free trade and Wall Street would seem odd.

        Phone still works if I stick a T-Mobile SIM in it, so it seems like my Fi SIM did just mysteriously die when I got back into the country
        Sooooo, anyone in SF got a spare Fi SIM?
        And also, wtf? How does a SIM just die to the extent that the phone refuses to believe it's even there?
        Weirdest thing about this is that the phone *does* detect that there's a SIM and it's for Project Fi
        It just doesn't join the network sigh
        Update: It just suddenly found a network again and is now stuck on "Activating"
        And now I'm fully activated and online again so that's good

        At what point will Trump supporters confront the fact that their candidate is a giant pervert piece of shit bigot? #FaceRealityhttps://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/786346966259265536 ... 
        I think @DylanByers is just now starting to understand that the media finds specific narratives and exploits them during a news cycle.
        This #RepealThe19th shit is the epitome of scared men cowering in fear of a world where they don't continue to have every possible advantage
        Andrew, if there's any footage of you and Trump together in the same room, I would hope you'd make it public to save us from yourself.https://twitter.com/acoyne/status/786359870232461312 ... 
        Trump is a racist bigot, a violent sexual offender, and awful at business. He exudes almost nothing positive. He's a black hole.
        It's cowardice²https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/786360051971743744 ... 
        It's amazing how skewed their worldview is. Anything Hillary says is damning yet everything Trump says is "a joke." Words cannot express...https://twitter.com/clmazin/status/786366885503733760 ... 
        At least 50 women will come forward with legitimate sexual assault claims about Trump. His supporters should be ashamed of themselves.
        Being needlessly contrarian in these times is dangerous. If you don't like Hillary, at least she won't throw you in jail for disagreeing.
        He absolutely should.https://twitter.com/michikokakutani/status/786394417280143360 ...
