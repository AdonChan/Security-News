        Worth spelling out: most advice I give publicly is advice you should follow until/unless you know confidently why/how/when it's wrong.
        Most advice is like that anyway, knowingly or not. I.e. "in Go don't use reflection" (unless proficient), "use TouchID" (unless rare cases).

        Apple has long said signing pkg/dmg containers is to thwart malicious dependencies being shipped with your .app. Nothing new to see here.
        @JZdziarski More importantly, a corrupted icon file doesn't lead to code exec any more than a jpeg with some steganography. I don't get it.
        . @chmod007 the real story here is that Dropbox doesn't codesign their .dmg file, so nobody should trust their app anyway.
        There's a reason you can corrupt an Application's icon and not affect code signature: It's completely non-code related and non-exploitable.

        If someone with a kext cert wants to add me to their team, I'd sign Little Flocker with it until Apple gets around to my request.
        I don't get it, did people really expect NSA/GCHQ and any other agency to seriously disclose any meaningful 0day?
        If your defense is "I'm not a troll, you are", and you opened up a second account just to circumvent a block, guess who's the troll?
        I'm sorry, but "if I have root I can uninstall software" is not a critical vulnerability.

        hey @gnupg will we see a more thorough analysis of the libgcrypt rng bug, e.g. from the finders? right now info a bit scarce
        The discussion about bug-hoarding shows the unhealthy fascination with 0day vs. proper engineering to become resilient against attack.
        I also find it nonsensical to discuss "do not bug hoard" without forcing vendors to publish all their executables in public ledgers.

        I will happily admit to having sat on 0day for long periods of time. Couldn't be bothered to deal with vendors / disclosure, too time-sinky.

        It's tough to get security appliances to audit, many vendors blacklist me (seriously). If you work for a vendor & want to help, let me know.

        I will happily admit to having sat on 0day for long periods of time. Couldn't be bothered to deal with vendors / disclosure, too time-sinky.
        Especially as it was my hobby, not my job, to find bugs at that time. Also: My experience is that a few weeks of fun technical work can ...
        .. turn into months of phone conferences and general "Wichtigtuerei" if one is not careful.
        The only thing that stopped me from doing this was natural bug attrition and not having enough time to find new bugs (e.g. advanced age).
        I think my GPU and OpenGL would be much more useful if it could eat double coordinates instead of floats for vertices.
        I also find it nonsensical to discuss "do not bug hoard" without forcing vendors to publish all their executables in public ledgers.
        Be worried about signing keys that are ubiquitously stolen already, by various actors. A public ledger hurts attackers on all sides.
        A legal ban on bug hoarding weakens intelligence agencies of liberal democracies with well-controlled intelligence services only.
        The discussion about bug-hoarding shows the unhealthy fascination with 0day vs. proper engineering to become resilient against attack.
        After just 3 days exposure to GPUs, shaders, and the ability to introspect / debug GSLS, I understand why people want Xeon Phis instead.

        . @librab103 does it even do anything to address "BadUSB" style attacks??
        . @CCrowMontance I think the question is whether or not someone can show it's bad. If not, perhaps this is a misconception...
        . @TheCybergoof @librab103 you're ok with headphones that are actually a usb keyboard that starts typing when plugged in?

        Prospective student, in hallway: Is this the electrical engineering department?
        I think we may need to upgrade our attribution dice to an attribution roulette wheel.
        RC6 in OFB mode is now officially "NSA-grade cryptography".
        Thus demonstrating that "NSA-grade crypto" tells us about the crypto roughly what "military-grade food" tells us about the food.
        For whatever reason I seem to have picked up a bunch of followers who see absolutely everything through the lens of the 2nd amendment.
        That must be a pretty scary way to live.  Hope you find peace.
        Some nice reporting on the NSA/TAO exploit dump by @nakashimae & @kansasalps.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsas-use-of-software-flaws-to-hack-foreign-targets-posed-risks-to-cybersecurity/2016/08/17/657d837a-6487-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html ... 
        I wonder if NSA discovered that they lost the TAO exploit trove in 2013 or just now? If in 2013, why didn't they report the Cisco 0day?
        This is basically a question of whether the Vulnerability Equities Process is merely very broken, or unbelievably broken.
        Radio geeks: some pretty good UHF tropo conditions in the northeast right now. Seeing ducting between Philly & Boston.
        The TAO dump (so far at least) suggests very little NSA magic; mostly scale + ability to leverage relatively mundane vuls effectively.
        This is unsurprising, but still vaguely reassuring.
        Don't use a firewall; that's how the NSA attacks you.  #BadSecurityAdvice
        In 3 years of secrets hemorrhaging out of NSA, there's so far been virtually nothing that's changed our understanding of security or crypto.
        But there's been a lot to reinforce what we already knew. (e.g., bugs can be leveraged, clouds are dangerous, etc).
        Of course, we don't know what the more deeply held and protected secrets are. But still, biggest NSA surprise has been how few surprises.
        It's notable how far "Patch your systems, turn off unneeded services, hire & retain competent administrators" gets you against even NSA.
        (Oh, yeah, and "Use Tor / Use Signal", of course.)

        Ok, here are a few observations on the importance of the Federal gov't not using for-profit prisons.
        1. It shows that the Federal gov't structures entire industries based purely on procurement decisions.
        2. It is effectively signaling a halt in a long-standing trend towards privatization of core elements of sovereignty.
        3. It shows that big money is simply not the only factor in political change. Publicity, reporting, activism, political leadership matter.

        A proper tool can be used for harm, yes - that's one of the ways you know it's effective! - but a tool -should- produce more good than harm.
        And given half of y'all identify as hackers, y'all have no excuse -not- to consider off-label uses. ;-)
        On one hand, this should make abuse much harder.

        Cisco shouldn't downplay the EXTRABACON vulnerability. It's a big deal and they have every right to be ticked off

        Oh well. Back to reality where people delude themselves into harming others in the name of patriotism or whatever.
        The TAO dump (so far at least) suggests very little NSA magic; mostly scale + ability to leverage relatively mundane vuls effectively.
        It's notable how far "Patch your systems, turn off unneeded services, hire & retain competent administrators" gets you against even NSA.
