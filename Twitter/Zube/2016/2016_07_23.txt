        There are no lies at #RNCinCLE . They really are that crazy.
        This is the election America deserves. #RNCinCLE
        Most of what Trump says about Hillary is true. And he'll repeatedly pound that. Pretty sad, Democrats. #RNCinCLE
        I have lived to see America's true madness. #RNCinCLE
        I'm sure that immigrant violence is at much lower levels than it was during the early 19th century. #RNCinCLE
        "Johnny, tell America what it's won!" #RNCinCLE
        Trump's speech resembles an SCTV spoof that's gone on too long but then suddenly becomes a statement on performance art. #RNCinCLE
