        Demian Maia def. Carlos Condit via Sub (RNC) at 1:52 of Round 1. #UFCVancouver

        Since everyone now has 23mins to spare, why not check out my Demian Maia Study playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKb7D4fR_VOijMZ8LUbm1rFrgcwimoDjf ... 
        To be more specific, Condit knew Maia wanted left leg single. Was baiting him & denying him, baited with a slow jab, but Maia was under it.
        Maia then stuffed knee/leg from ever establishing hip posture. This muted Condor's closed guard game and Carlos's desire to elbow clinched.
        From then on, Condit going into deep half is logical move/defense - and feeds into Maia's preferred game as @bjjscout noticed.
        Everything Condit does, try to shrug Maia off, open hips, handfighting, trying footlock on Maia, rolling, peeling hands off head is right.
        But Maia surprised with his squeeze strength, shifting of feet past footlock positioning, rolling Condit away from inside figure four foot.
        People will tell you that "Maia just does basic jiu jitsu" and they'll believe it. But they're wrong. So many adjustments. Fine control.

        So this was the puma night run in Singapore that was disturbing my sleep.
        Remember folks, sharing is caring. Not sharing while going for publicity is a great way to further your business but losing competitive TL
        TLDR; if you can't share because it will blow the integrety of a investigation, you probably should get quoted in WSJ, in my opinion
        Why hasnt anyone blogged about Canada's, Donald Trump's and Donald Duck's relationship with NSO Group? #BuildTheNorthernWallNow
        really surprised that @swissotel stamford did not warn guests of puma night run happening right outside and noise involved on sunday night

        "Technical report" is a relatively generous term for that paper. #nsoday
        Afaik there was an iOS5 untether in an optional exploit pack for #canvas that abused jsc. So apple removed binary in iOS6 & put it back in 7
        As usual, neither report contains *any* detailed analysis of the exploits, only the malware payload. The skills to do so are too uncommon.
        The lack of exploit analysis skill has consequences. No IOCs for pre-compromise detections. You have to wait until you get 0wned to find it.
        PLEASE, WONT SOME VENDOR MARKETING DEPARTMENT HOST A WEBINAR TO TELL ME HOW I CAN PROTECT MYSELF FROM "TODAY'S SOPHISTICATED THREATS"???!!!!

        I didn't do health policy during the ACA debate but plenty of people pointed out problems. Maybe ask one of the people who got it right.
        The problem is obviously an overlapping series of monopolies. See the Epipen episode for an example.
        Hospital mergers for example.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/janfeb-2014/after-obamacare/ ... 
        1. Ok, quick tweetstorm on the politics of productivity. Productivity is the perhaps the most important stat in economics.
        2. It distinguishes b/n rich and poor countries, b/n countries getting wealthier or poorer, etc.
        3. Basically if you can make more stuff with the same amount of labor and machines, you get richer. If you can't you don't.
        4. Right now, productivity in the US is dropping. That's bad. Maybe the drop is just statistical noise, but productivity growth is low. Bad!
        5. One major theory, put forward by economist Robert Gordon, is that we've just run out of stuff to invent. http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10544.html ... 
        6. His story essentially is that the toilet was a far more important invention than the computer. We'll never invent another toilet again.
        7. He argues that the productivity growth in 1800 and 1900s was, civilization-speaking, a one shot deal.
        8. There are counter-arguments. I asked him once about, you guessed it, monopoly. Monopolists prevent a lot of productivity growth.
        9. Not all. Monopolists will deploy productivity-enhancing stuff that enhances their power. But they block everything else, or try to.
        10. Gordon's stats showed highest productivity growth in 1930s and 1940s, the heyday of anti-monopoly policy. I thought he'd be open to it.
        11. But he looked at me like I was crazy to associate monopoly and productivity. It was weird.
        12. Three days ago Gordon wrote a piece for the FT calling for tax cuts for corporations to boost productivity. https://www.ft.com/content/bd6a06ce-63b7-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227 ... 
        13. My guess is that he's consulting for big business. Who knows? It's not disclosed. Regardless it's totally inconsistent with his big idea
        14. His pushing 'capital formation' is an important tell about how he actually thinks about the world.
        15. And now I find that he wrote a Brookings paper in 2003 titled "Exploding Productivity Growth"https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/exploding-productivity-growth-context-causes-and-implications/ ... 
        16. I don't have a problem with people changing their minds. But there's something self-serving going on. And this debate matters.
        17. That is all.

        The reason Apple is so far ahead of Android on phone security has very little to do with its posture towards zero-days.
        In fact (and this so obvious to people in field as to be banal) their success -- powerful success -- has come in spite of their vuln posture.
