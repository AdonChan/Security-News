        The only thing about the UPPERCASE protector is that it's non-stick so it can slide off your keyboard pretty easily, better than gooey keys.
        Unfortunately, the real-time measurements of battery for me are even worse than the estimates; about 2-3 hours on average. Hoping for a fix.

        Question for Facebook workers: Would you be willing to unionize, to serve as a check on collaborationist management? Signal: +1 415 610 0231
        Same question goes to Twitter and Google people. Your management isn't doing enough. Do you want to form a union?
        Q: I have to protect against cavities, my threat model is basically candy, sugars, etc. etc.
        The only meaningful leverage over big tech company policies right now comes from employees. To use that leverage, we need to organize
        @Pinboard @vnoel Twitter homegrown crypto would be a site to behold
        @Pinboard Had to work collectively against a shitty employer after management upheaval at a prior company--it felt so good
        If it upsets you to see your CEO filing in to Trump Tower to kiss the ring, understand that organizing as a labor force will stop that
        Every time I see the phrase "unionized workplace", I regret minoring in organic chemistry.
        @Pinboardpic.twitter.com/7nesP7qq55
        Isn't there ~100 years of law around this? RT @mhashemi: i've heard from a few different engineers that unions are a contractual no-go
        those of you who are not sure about unionizing should look at the concessions that @pinboard workers have won from management
        I'm helping host conversations with Tech Solidarity in NY and Boston next week. Message @Pinboard on Signal (see feed) if yr interested.https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/808743871438090240 ... 
        Being in a union is pretty sweet. For instance, our cleaning lady who belongs to my old union, often tells me about her 5 weeks of vacation
        You get to have a union hall, call each other "union brothers and sisters", elect a shop steward, be respected by the management, do chants.

        @SwiftOnSecurity @GossiTheDog Sure, but I've often seen "we don't need the security folks, I've got this" leading to bigger problems later
        Lazy response: Wow, DNC IT guy sucks at sec.
        @pwnallthethings @SwiftOnSecurity Best response: Wow, maybe our company should learn from DNC's mistake. IT/Sec, what is our process?
        NYT story is an excellent summary, but I want to emphasize: We knew this all before the election. We had great threads about it months ago.
        All those stories with juicy details about hacking? We already knew that. There's almost nothing new.
        The DNC hacking story isn't about computers or security, it is about the failure of every institution you thought made America exceptional.
        What would an exceptional people have done.

        That said, librarians and archivists are the unsung heroes of truth. We need them now more than ever.
        Observation: far more noise than signal is eliminated when you block people whose first interaction with you points out how stupid you are.
        "You are stupid" is a singularly unpersuasive argument, and yet it's the Twitter version of "hello" for so many lately.
        I wished someone "happy holidays" earlier which feels all edgy and transgressive now. I'm a badass rebel with bland pleasantries.
        If your idea of discrimination involves insufficiently festive coffee cups, of course you'll be indifferent when it happens to others.

        Just learning about the fin-syn rules, the anti-monopoly regulations for TV that forced networks to use independent producers.
        Independently produced shows showed a wider range of creativity, racial and gender diversity, and risk-taking. Some great shows.
        The Cosby Show, Mary Tyler Moore, Sanford and Sons, Seinfeld, All in the Family, Golden Girls, Roseanne --> all a function of anti-monopoly.
        Rule promulgated in 1970 by Nixon's FCC (yes NIXON!!!) and then finally killed in 1993 by Clinton. https://www.justice.gov/archive/atr/public/press_releases/1993/211669.htm ... 
        Yes, Reagan squashed FCC's effort to kill rule as favor to Hollywood. @matthewstoller
        @matthewstoller And producer could push back on network because of the functioning market. One network wanted Cosby to be Vegas act not Dr.
        @matthewstoller Networks actually competed for content because producer could take show elsewhere. Led to more ground breaking choices.

        Headlines always read, China hacked the US, Russia hacked the US, Iran hacked the US. Why do we not see any where theyre hacking each other?
        @jeremiahg @munin what makes you think hacking the US isn't hacking each other?
        the cloud is just someone else's computer.
        NYT story is an excellent summary, but I want to emphasize: We knew this all before the election. We had great threads about it months ago.
        All those stories with juicy details about hacking? We already knew that. There's almost nothing new.
        The DNC hacking story isn't about computers or security, it is about the failure of every institution you thought made America exceptional.

        Fascism is slow & creeping. It starts with a small request, something innocuous, maybe even, from someone with good intentions.

        /3 And that narrative was hacked by lots of people. Including Clinton.
        /4 It doesn't take collusion between Putin and Wikileaks to screw the Dem's narrative when the GOP and Clinton herself were helping so much.
        /5 What the hacks did was keep the focus on Clinton's e-mails. Wikileaks added to drumbeat of Benghazi hearings, JudicialWatch, FBI.
        /6 Add the news reporting on all those together, and the link between the words "Clinton" and "e-mail" became unbreakable.
        /7 If you took all the news reporting over the past 18 mos, put it into a Markov chain bot, it would spit out "Clinton e-mail" 50% of time.
        /8 The intent of Wikileaks was to damage Clinton's legitimacy, for obvious reasons. Clinton once asked why US couldn't drone Assange.
        /9 The intent of the Russians was: get back at Clinton for sanctions, at US for Panama Papers, to disrupt NATO, undermine US moral authority
        /10 ... or some combination of the above. Not necessarily to put Trump in White House, as big as a win as that has been for Putin.
        /11 The GOP was also out to damage Clinton. Judicial Watch was out to damage Clinton. James Comey? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  Cover his ass.
        /12 But none of this would have been possible if Clinton and the DNC hadn't own-goaled themselves repeatedly & lost touch with the narrative
        /13 Meanwhile, all this "fake news" bs? The real story is that social media has let us ignore voices saying things we don't like.
        /14 The "election hacking" claims--as in what Jill Stein is trying to prove--are really just providing cover for very real voting issues...
        /15 like voter suppression through reduced polling places, voter ID laws, and political gerrymandering. The *states* have hacked elections.
        /16 So while Wikileaks and Russia both played a role in setting narrative, it was a minor supporting role, not an outcome-changer.

        It's funny to read Mailpile talking about how hostile Signal is to federation, since "federation" is why SMTP security is a backwater.
