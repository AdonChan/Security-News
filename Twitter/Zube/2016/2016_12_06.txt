        "Putting politics aside... " is the new "I'm not racist, but... "
        Sometimes you can't put politics aside. You'll either decide that it's okay to collaborate with Trump, or it isn't. Don't weasel around it
        The best thing written on collaborating with Trump is unsurprisingly from Masha Gessenhttp://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/27/trump-realism-vs-moral-politics-choice-we-face/ ...

        Everyone know that the correct solution to screenwriting is a blockchain
        Revision control as used by screenwriters is fascinating. Programmers, try to read this without your eye twitching http://www.scriptchick.net/Info/Revisions.html ... 
        I got as far as the chart of colors used for revision marking before I needed alcohol
        "Since our work gets xeroxed and faxed... colored paper won't work for us. This is why having the color name written on the page is imperative"
        In your youth, you look at inefficient systems and think how to trivially fix them. Later, you look at them and wonder what you don't know
        Say what you will about scriptwriting, at least a mistyped comma can't destroy the set of a $100M production
        @Pinboard Most people have colored paper. Only the supervisor has a white copy.
        I notice that the 2015 vintage 15" MacBook Pros are sold out until at least mid-December. Not a lot of #courage out there!

        Don't believe anyone who tells you that populism won in Italy today. The populism of elites has lost - along with Renzi, Amazon, McKinsey.
        Renzi: the worst kind of populism of the elites. Promising the impossible with nothing but buzzwords and empty gestures at Silicon Valley.pic.twitter.com/npWzeQdSbE
        On the plus side, now Renzi has more time to dine with Obama.
        Ironic: Alec Ross - unemployed as Clinton lost - talks tech & the FUTURE OF WORK with Renzi - to be unemployed soon!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efbXIpoJxOk ... 
        The shorter Renzi: Post-truth ate my homework.
        Amazing to watch how silly decisions (e.g. the referendum) and the collapse of neoliberal fake "social democracy" are blamed on post-truth
        Great job, @ale_dibattista - populism of the people beat the populism of the elitespic.twitter.com/zcGmBR63sc
        Am really worried how people like @RiccardoLuna will earn a living in post-Renzi Italy. They'll have to go back to writing about football...
        European social democrats, wake up & learn from Renzi: support basic income agenda BEFORE voters make you and your staff unemployed.
        My day job is to study nonsense about "the Web". I speak Italian. So: Renzi's bullshit about "the Web" is much worse & dangerous than M5S's.

        Reminder: whether an election was tampered with or not, insecure voting tech gives the losers license to cast doubt.
        Recounts and audits thus ultimately benefit the WINNER; they bolster the legitimacy of the election.
        Comprehensive audits are essential to securing voting tech; gives us insight into the threat environment. Should be done in EVERY election.
        We know there are exploitable vulnerabilities in e-voting systems. We don't know whether they're actually exploited. Audits help tell us.
        Unfortunately, US elections are run on shoestring budgets (compare w/ campaigns). No $$ to pay for most of this, to our national shame.
        Funding what should be routine election audits by having a fringe candidate raise $$ in the aftermath of a tight election seems suboptimal.

        Trump's nat sec advisor promoted the "pizzagate" conspiracy nonsense. A gunman showed up there today.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/12/04/d-c-police-respond-to-report-of-a-man-with-a-gun-at-comet-ping-pong-restaurant/ ... 
        Do these people not understand that this stuff has consequences, or do they just not care?
        Pizzagate's a politically-tinged version of 80's McMartin preschool/satanic ritual panic. Requires suspending critical faculties to believe.
        But once bought into, it becomes a snowballing positive feedback loop. Denials become proof.
        McMartin preschool case, by the way, is a terrifying case study in modern American (literal) witch hunts.
        Anyway, the parallels here are striking; McMartin case also involved supposed secret tunnels.
        I think I liked the pre-post-truth era better.

        Or make massive propaganda edits to wikipedia?

        But no; it's all basic "DoS this guy" or "relay spam"
