        One man's lowly bug is another company's press release.
        I have to strongly disagree with the statement in this story that all phones are hacked.  Total FUD.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-hacking-your-phone/ ... 
        Dramatic re-enactment of @csima's discovery of SQL injection back in the 90s, via @duosec Hacker History series:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FogXO4l60Q ... 
        First round of blackhat talks announced.  I'll be interested to see this one: https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices ...  since its a CAN traffic tool.
        As a "professional" car hacker, I don't need a tool beyond Vehicle Spy and the ecomcat we released.  But I'm ready to see what I'm missing!
        A lot of people seem to build CAN tools, but really it is a simple protocol, don't need to do much.  Maybe because Vehicle Spy costs money?
        ...and I guess you need an ecom cable for ecomcat, which is $179. But you're car hacking a car, seems like a small investment in comparison.
        I'll be curious to see what they come up with as I've been doing tons of CAN stuff lately.  See if they could have made my life easier.
        for me personally, right now, tooling is not the limiting factor for me (unless you mean embedded ECU debuggers or something which I need!)
        Everyone complains about harassment at cons.  I find my approach of staying in my room the whole time an effective approach.
        My last tweet was a joke whose premise is based on my introvertism and how I don't get harassed anyway due to my male privilege
        Watched the Snowden movie trailer.  I don't get how he hacked the Rubik's cube, tho. Also that NSA office looking way nicer than I remember.

        Me and @nudehaberdasher are officially one person now according to @DarkReading.  I already knew this but guess it's official now.
        That Michigan bill http://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/billintroduced/Senate/htm/2016-SIB-0927.htm ...  doesn't make sense to me.
        it says: A PERSON SHALL NOT INTENTIONALLY ACCESS ... AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OF A MOTOR VEHICLE TO WILLFULLY... ALTER... THE MOTOR VEHICLE.
        When you turn the steering wheel, you are accessing an electronic system to willfully alter the motor vehicle.  Happily IANAL.

        But like so much else, American killer folklore has decayed, leaving us with George Zimmerman.
        If a counterculture existed, young artists might strip Zimmerman down to his disgusting core, exposing, mocking, then dispensing of his ass
        But there is no counterculture: only a flat line of endless ads where Zimmerman sells his gun. And you're still surprised by Trump?

        Advertising is a disease. It's fucking everywhere and cheapens everything.You can't read an article without having to endure ads.
        And it's not even good advertising.
        Politics are the worst I've ever seen it. Hillary versus Trump? Jesus in Heaven, seriously? How can that not make you ill?
        Online "debate" is anything but. People spew shit that's pumped into their heads. Arguments are at best ankle deep. Don't wear white shoes.
        Again, love those you love. Deeply. That's pretty much all we have left. Maybe that's all we ever had.

RegexTip

        Inside a character class, dash means range. For example, [0-9] matches any digit. Outside a character class dash has no special meaning.
        Inside a character class, period and question mark are not special. For example, [.?] matches a period or a question mark.
        Inside a character class, ^ means 'not'. For example, [^abc] matches any character except a, b, or c.
        Outside a character class, ^ means 'start at the beginning of a line'. Example: /^The/ matches lines that begin with 'The'.
        $ anchors a regular expression at the end of a strings. Example: /end$/ matches strings ending in 'end'.
        (When a string contains newline characters, whether $ may match the end of the line or the end of the string depends on regex settings.)
        THE book on regular expressions is Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey Friedlhttp://bit.ly/6CY6Ub 
        Just what do you mean by "number"? http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/04/18/just-what-do-you-mean-by-number/ ... 
        \s matches white space, i.e. space, tab, newline, etc. Example: /foot\s+ball/ matches 'foot ball'  but not 'football'.
        \S matches anything but white space, i.e. \S is the opposite of \s.  This is a common pattern with upper case vs lower case.
        \d matches any digit, i.e. [0-9]. \D matches anything except a digit, i.e. [^0-9].
        \w matches any 'word' character, i.e. letters, numbers, and underscore. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
        \W matches any non-word character, anything \w doesn't match.
        Reminder: * means zero or more, + means one or more, ? means zero or one.
        .@RegexTip is brought to you by http://JohnDCook.com pic.twitter.com/ykLS3To6CK
        Parentheses and | denote options. Example: /(red|green|blue) truck/ matches 'red truck' or 'green truck' or 'blue truck'.
        Parentheses have the side effect of capturing, setting \1 to the stuff matched by the first set of parentheses, \2 to the second, etc.
        *, +, and ? are considered greedy quantifiers. They are going to consume matching tokens before moving on to the next atom.
        vi and vim's engine uses \+ and \= in place of the more common + and ?.
        'Perl Best Practices' recommends always using /xms on regexes. /x to allow whitespace & comments, /m and /s to handle newlines as expected.
        If a dash is the first or last character in a character class, it is a literal dash and does not indicate a range.
        Using regular expressions in C++ http://ow.ly/YhS7v 
        Perl stores the content of the previous match in $&, the text to the left of the match in $`, and the text to the right in $'.
        [a-z] matches all lower case letters. [-az] matches '-', 'a', or 'z'.
        You can include comments inside a regex with (?# ... ).  For example, /the\s+(?# One or more spaces)end
        If you're going to work with regular expressions, it's worthwhile to learn Perl notation even if you don't intend to ever use Perl.
        Using regular expressions in PowerShell http://bit.ly/4uIqtf 
        \d represents the numerical characters, or [0123456789]. Its complement is \D.
        More Twitter accounts like @RegexTip 
        Look-around in regular expressions matches a LOCATION, not a set of characters.

        So, I just had my first experience with systemd on a physical box I own, and unsurprisingly, systemd/udev idiocy broke it & wasted hours.
        The box in question is the LANDISK (sh4 box) that was donated to me for kernel maint work.
        Debian-sh4's systemd/udev mess decided to rename eth0 to enp0s0 despite having "eth0" in the /etc/network/interfaces I was given.
        On top of that, their dhcp client decided not to add any route unless the dhcp server gave an explicit subnet, so arping worked but not ping

        Also we have these things called whales that are already hoovering up krill, and Antarctic sea ice is net increasing. Christ what an asshole
        The New Yorker did this to me last time, too, with the Seattle earthquake article.
        Last thing I wrote got slashdotted, this time I made the front page of DIGG. Zombie websites love him!http://digg.com

        I toyed with calling my upcoming Antarctic thing 'Voyage to the End of the World', but found a title that's SO MUCH BETTER. Eat it, Franzen!
        Truthers crowdfunding something that won't happen. This should be a good one.https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/september-11th-redux#/ ... 
        New Yorker editor: this is great material, Franzen, but could you prepend 5000 words about your family history before you mention penguins?
        Franzen's girlfriend: "this is beautiful, honey, but could you refer to me as 'the Californian'? I don't like people knowing we're a couple"
        I've hated Franzen's prose for years because of stupid shit he writes about the Internet, and this is an exciting opportunity to branch out
        The science in the Franzen thing is horrible. He cites trends on the Antarctic peninsula as if they held for the continent, which they don't
        If anybody knows someone who was on the Lindblad cruise with Franzen, I would love to talk to them about the experience
        Playing bridge, citing Beckett and Mann, jump starting a car, getting an Argentine visa for his brother--Franzen brings the Antarctic to life
        This is making me rethink everything I have left to write about Antarctica. Did you know my grandma worked in a hosiery factory? Buckle up.
        @baconmeteor Isn't this the guy who pondered adopting a child from Africa so he could understand the plight of the continent?

        Franzen should disclose what Lindblad paid him for the slogan "How much better it was to be bored and frozen by seawatching than to be dead"
        Here's a long rant by Franzen's girlfriend about living with his ass. Life is a carnival of laughter for these two:http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/22/extract ...

        Just because an attack is basic doesn't mean it's not a sophisticated actor. Some of the best adversaries do only the bare minimum required
        There is very little incentive (risk is actually introduced) to use advanced capabilities and tactics when they aren't required.

        Oh @amtrak, this thing where you randomly locked my (and lots of others') account and can't seem to unlock it must be great for business.

        Zillionaire grudgefunding is a formidable adversary.
        I strongly feel I don't have a strong opinion about whether [Ii]nternet should be capitalized.
        The legal system doesn't seem to be designed to be robust against a zillionaire abusing it to settle unrelated grudges.
        I think Theil may have just edged out McAffe for Trump's perfect running mate.
        Congrats to @joncallas and Apple, which made a smart move luring him back.
        I find Gawker repellant, too, but I ultimately care more about press freedom than the freedom of billionaires to exact capricious revenge.
        (I reserve the right to change my values once I become a bitter, petty and capricious billionaire.)
        Now people are telling me I'm wrong, because I don't understand that Gawker is repellant.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/735652629800464384 ... 
        Note that I'm not saying Gawker deserved to win (or lose) this particular suit. The outcome of the suit isn't the troubling part to me.
        ... what I'm troubled by is that this strategy - targeted expensive lawsuits - could easily shut down far less unsavory media orgs.
        The fact that you're a billionaire and those people who wronged you aren't seems like pretty good revenge all by itself.
        Gawker's vileness aside, the implications of billionaire grudge-funding at scale might be worth thinking about before applauding too hard.
        Billionaires should focus on important things, like making life a living hell for my high school gym teacher. No, I haven't forgotten.
        One thing I seriously don't understand about Thiel's funding the Gawker case is why the normal contingency fee model wouldn't have worked.
        (Actually, my HS gym teacher was a perfectly nice fellow by gym teacher standards. Billionaire friends: call off the plan, please.)

        I've been trying to engage Purism into making more trustworthy laptops for months. Sadly they seem to prefer launching new products and PR.
        @rootkovska they are using security as part of their brand identity. Before that it was Linux purity. Neither market is big enough :)

        Sadly, the presented approaches seem either: 1) lead to a platform DoS, or 2) require asking ME to disable itself.https://twitter.com/_deepfire/status/734005224948523008 ... 
        And it's rather dubious to rely on Intel ME to disable itself: if we trust it that much, then why not assume it simply is non-harmful to us?
        ... not to mention Intel can patch any of these "ask ME to disable itself" interfaces in no time...

        And yet another case of forking Chromium for "security" because of your virus expertise. Seriously, you're going to screw it up.
        With regard to "secure browsers" implemented by AVs: in general, do not ever use your AV's supplied browser. I've analyzed 3. All broken.
        @taviso Did you notice that it's the AdtrustMedia (of PrivDog fame) Ad Sanitizer extension that is at fault? http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/305096

        I just got an ad on twitter for "The Facebook of Cyber Threats"...wat.
        In retrospect, the worm authors of the previous decade actually performed a great public service, and we're worse off for their absence now.
        Working on an unusual exploit for Comodo Antivirus, just *scanning* a file can exfiltrate keystrokes. #wtfpic.twitter.com/NKmPGh2DMW

        I get asked constantly what av to use. You're missing the point; av creates more problems than it solves, and we're overdue an av slammer.
        You would expect AV vendors to be experts at parsing PE files. Nope, trivial memory corruption all over the place. Report on the way @Avira
        Is it really asking too much for security software vendors to learn how filesystem ACL's work? *Every* single vendor screws this up. #wtf
        If you work in antivirus, go learn how to use icacls.exe now so you won't look like this when I check it for you.pic.twitter.com/SB8Oz23BH8
        That was quick, Avira patched the first report already.  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=765 ... 
        Another trivial RCE in @TrendMicro default install. This is getting ridiculous. Report on the way #sighpic.twitter.com/hwWqHm6umR
        Apparently a Nessus scan finds a trivial EoP in Trend Micro due to bad ACLs. #wtfhttps://twitter.com/LaktoseIgnoranz/status/710968245566750720 ... 
        Lots of fixes and improvements to Comodo Antivirus being released tomorrow, including ASLR being enabled on scan process. Really impressed.

        I looked at security product websites today. I am a security expert, but often can't figure out what the product does, or is supposed to do.
