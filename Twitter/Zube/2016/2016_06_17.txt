        Sorry, I mean "firearms". You're not supposed to call then "guns" or they make fun of you.

        MS is attempting to move to a strict prescriptive method here.

        "So on June 23rd, think about the foreigner coming to kill you with a scimitar and not the reduced opportunities for growth. Vote Leave."
        Nigel Farage: the shoddy little spiv flogging nylons out of the back of a Ford Anglia who became Britain's top fascist cunt.
        Just been called racist by a UKIP supporter. I'm practically spluttering with incomprehension.
        As far as I can see, the reasoning is that because the UKIP supporter didn't see me queueing to give up my house to migrants...  (1/2)
        ... I was racist because as a result the migrants would have to sleep outside. (2/2)
        Britain absolutely fucking last.
        The shooting of Jo Cox is obviously a false flag operation by the nine-dimensional yeti.
        Well, we're a grim little country, aren't we.
        Nigel's cheeky chappy fascism did this. He emboldened the racists an inch at a time, made their opinions appear valid again. They aren't.
        They never were and they never will be. Migrants aren't the problem. We are. Britons made this happen and Britons let this happen.
        Boris and Gove are complicit too. They've joyfully peddled the idea not that Britain is superior, but that everyone else is inferior.
        The idea of "taking our country back" has connotations far beyond just the Leave campaign, and the Leave campaign knows that.
        Racists have been pandered to in the name of votes for a cause that has celebrated small-mindedness and insularity.
        But the racists are too stupid to see they're being used. And now one has stepped up and done this, thinking he'll be cheered by Nigel.
        But the people who encouraged this murderer's actions will disclaim all responsibility. He was a lone wolf, nothing to do with us.
        But people who despise this new fascism haven't spoken loudly enough, have let it slide and hoped for the best. We're responsible too.
        I don't know what to do or how to fight these bastards. I'm an idiot who posts jokes on Twitter. I want nothing to do with the world.
        But like it or not the world comes and gets you. Migrants aren't coming -- fascism is. And I feel helpless to stop it.
        Perhaps I've jumped the gun. Perhaps it will emerge that he wasn't a right wing nutter but had some other axe to grind.
        But when the best you can hope for is that the murderer of a woman wasn't a fascist, I think I'll stand by my point, whatever that was.
