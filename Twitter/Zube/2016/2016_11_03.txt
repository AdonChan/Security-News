        Whatever you do, users will always remain the weakest security link in your system. Don't ignore user education.
        Five #ActiveDirectory tasks you should automate right now!
        If somebody shares admin accounts, you'll never know who to blame if something goes wrong
        Don't put all user information that you have in AD. Some things (e.g. SSNs) just don't belong therepic.twitter.com/ISuEKwP6We
        If you add additional privileges to some accounts during testing, make sure you take them back
        Adding proper descriptions to AD groups should be enforced. Never leave group descriptions blancpic.twitter.com/IDnI21895p
        Make a plan to retire your legacy systems. They are often targeted by attackers as weak points
        Keeping your #ActiveDirectory clean is very important! Here's how to do that with #PowerShell
        Admin accounts should have a separate naming convention (often more than one), so they can be easily differentiated #BestPractice
        It's best to use a separate machine as a DC and not share the role
        Group owners should be managing AD group membership, not administrators #Delegation #bestpractice

        It's frustrating to see Apple lock out old hardware from security updates. You should not be left exposed if you don't pay Apple even more.

        TIP: If you have Ricoh devices, you can use Device Manager NX for free to scan your entire network and disable protocols like SSH/telnet/FTPpic.twitter.com/8RhqdjbgfX
        Maybe I should write blog posts instead of just randomly tweeting out useful info between stupid GIFs
        Device Manager NX Lite can inventory your ENTIRE network's printer devices, get data, of any manufacturer. I have 145 it tracks. Free.
        Did you know that all your enterprise printers come with NetWare and AppleTalk and SMB turned on? I shut that shut that down like Todd Akin.pic.twitter.com/ijXgVjlBNN
        You can also use Device Manager NX to set all your printer's admin passwords and email server authentication settings. It's super neato.
        Turning off these protocols completely neuters most exploits against printer firmware, and it cuts down network noise too.
        Listen to me: If you think you're just a routine sysadmin and you don't have anything to contribute to security, you're so fucking wrong.
        As a sysadmin on the ground, you see stuff and tools normal security people have no idea about. You bring a different perspective.
        IT security is treated like all-knowing masters of every facet of networks and devices, but it's not true. Nobody knows it all.
        @SwiftOnSecurity HP Web Jetadmin provides similar functionality for HP printers: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/solutions/business-solutions/printingsolutions/wja.html ... 
        @SwiftOnSecurity for Kyocera you can use the Kyocera Net Viewer. Similar feature set.

        Would be an interesting experiment to full switch to only pgp encrypted emails. Would people adopt or ignore? Alas, pgp not built this way.
        Perhaps this requirement of a receiver to already be "in" is what's muted a more viral uptick. And of course usability.

        This. (I saw the "white paper", and had a similar reaction.)https://theintercept.com/2016/11/01/heres-the-problem-with-the-story-connecting-russia-to-donald-trumps-email-server/ ... 
        My conclusion: Donald Trump is a dangerous, unqualified megalomanic, beneath consideration for public office, but not because of this.

        How Waning Competition Deepens Labor's Plight - v powerful piece by NYT reporter @portereduardohttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/business/economy/how-waning-competition-deepens-labors-plight.html ... 
        I've heard a lot about Hillbilly Elegy and arguments about the culture of the white working class. A lot of this intersects with heroin.
        But you know, 'culture' is often a way to avoid talking policy. And there's policy involved in the opioid epidemic.
        Like this. A company named Merck Medco that fought the W. VA gov't to addict a good chunk of West Virginia to oxyhttps://www.statnews.com/2016/10/26/oxycontin-maker-thwarted-limits/ ... 
        Merck Medco is a pharmacy benefits manager. It's a financial middleman that flourishes on kickbacks and monopoly power.
        There's no "cultural problem" here. This is just straightforward raw financial power overriding a state gov't to kill people for money.
        Our medical institutions should not be allowed to kill Americans for money and wreck communities for kickbacks.
        There is a reason for anger and it's not outlandish. The cultural anger is a reaction to the very real attacks on people and communities.
        You don't have to learn about the increasingly exoticized culture of the white working class to be angry about this.

        In its first tweet in a year, @FBIRecordsVault calls Fred Trump a "philanthropist." A long word 4 a tweet. Files dont say he was & he wasn't
        Honored today for excellence in being the basis for truly awful security interview questions.https://twitter.com/MITREcorp/status/789255048597495809 ... 
        You have to get to the 4th graf to find language that is outside the mainstream of political punditry. Think about that.https://twitter.com/tedgeoghegan/status/793536408845684736 ... 
        This @daveweigel lead is right on. People write email in a hurry and in the expectation of privacy https://www.washingtonpost.com/pwa/#https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/why-dump-all-those-emails-doesnt-mean-what-drudge-thinks-it-does/ ... pic.twitter.com/QuCiEOC5xL
        When you read this, remember: if today was '84, people on message boards would be taking the '84 gap as an article of faith.https://twitter.com/amcafee/status/793589071369146368 ... 
        literally just got pitched by thiel's investment firm if they can invest in trello.  Nice fund you got there hope nothing happens to it
        Peter Thiel's support of Donald Trump is unconscionable and abhorant. Thank you @msuster for explaining it so wellhttps://bothsidesofthetable.com/and-then-they-came-for-me-ee970a6112c1#.axqmmbp0e ...

        Peter Thiel is that racist herb from one of your college classes except he's a powerful billionaire.https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/793626439379718144 ... 
        If Thiel still thinks "apartheid is a sound economic system working efficiently", how about US Jim Crow laws? Or slavery? Just "policies"?
        Can YCombinator and Facebook also find a way to defend admiration of apartheid as "diversity" or "political differences"? Let's see!

        Oh for fuck's sake, nerds, I'm not saying that YOUR ONLY ADVERSARIES are the police and people who steal your laptop.
        COMPUTER SECURITY is incredibly important and does repel criminals, stalkers, abusive spouses, whatever.
        This is basically the crux of my argument with Matt. I think: uh, no.https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/793829514388267008 ... 
        The polling dynamics are pretty clear: in weeks where Trump in the news, polls will show race artificially widened. Else: revert to true.
        Through that lens, Clinton could dominate news cycle for curing cancer and the race would still tighten, because no scary orange man on TV.
        Do note that Trump has just announced a new Wikileaks stolen doc dump *in advance*. Meanwhile, whither the FBI?
