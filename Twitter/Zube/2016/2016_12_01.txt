        ESET apparently doesn't care that their antivirus breaks a lot of other security tools running on Mac, and makes users' lives miserable.

        A lot of magical thinking and fear-spreading about "what-if" that actually requires privileged access to exploit.  @MDTPro @FrankLesniak
        Need new InfoSec practitioners to start off by designing within existing robust access control system we already have @MDTPro @FrankLesniak
        "If you dump the Active Directory then you can..."
        I thought this way for years, flailing around not trusting the access control platforms I was building on top of. Lots of wasted time.
        You need to start in security by building on what you have to work with. Protecting against "what-if" with future exploits comes much later.
        I'm very passionate about demystifying entry-level, day-to-day security and I just had a lot of coffee so I'm very talkative right now sorry
        Thanks, just to be clear I was talking about LAPS within a narrow scope of how most people deploy it who don't follow overall roadmap. https://twitter.com/fixtheexchange/status/804036431077380097 ... 
        So easy to talk about specific gotchas within security solutions, but you sound like you're saying it's not worth it. Need to be mindful. 
        Now with years in the field I actually sound like I know what I'm talking about, and it's terrible. I never asked for this.
        "Stop, I'm still same clueless person I was as a teenager, just older and now people trust what I say and I don't want that responsibility."

        7: we've built the world's most incredible hindsight machine as it relates to counterterrorism but forget recruitment happens to individuals
        8: we apply global commonalities in terrorism that never would be so applied in 'crime' cases. Yet locals solve/prevent 'crime' every day
        9: when anyone demands why 'we' didn't stop the latest 'terror' attack,  I just ask why 'we' didn't stop the latest 'bank robbery'.
        11: in our rush to make 'terror' a battle of narrative we've fallen sway to our own story telling, forgetting we aren't the target audience
        12: we acribe global significance to an individual psychosis, & then we dissect it in hopes of countering it through branding or messaging
        13: none of this excuses failures of feasible counterterrorism, but recent trends are of plots of one and comms obvious only after the fact

        @dakami @erratarob Time and time again, people ridiculed as "Luddites" have in fact had the right idea w.r.t. to a particular set of risks.
        Why AV is bad:
        2016: People still think that huge, complicated parsers, unpackers and interpreters in kernel mode are good if you call them "antivirus"
        While we don't know who got caught hacking Tor/Firefox users yesterday, it is almost certainly a government.

        Trump's tweets, etc, aside from their unhingedness,  suggest he still thinks he's running, not preparing to actually govern.

        Up @theintercept on Trump/Carrier talks,& how Obama had same opportunities 2 prevent outsourcing, but passed them uphttps://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/trumps-showdown-with-manufacturer-exposes-obamas-weakness-on-outsourcing/ ... 
        "Why the Bernie Sanders approach isn't enough for Democrats to win" 
        Basing your political choices solely on pandering to win elections is, ironically, a great way to lose elections as well as your dignity.
        If you have power, it's also a great way to hurt a lot of people.
        The obsession with all of this strategy-intelligence-savvy-polling-credentialism is just a way of avoiding that politics is about morality.
        Trump Admin and $UTX reach agreement on keeping close to 1000 factory jobs in Carrier plant in Indiana- sources.
        "Close to a thousand jobs?" And what kind of labor concessions are there?https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/803752722403098628 ... 
        So Trump was able to get a major defense contractor to 'only' offshore over a thousand jobs. And we have no details.https://twitter.com/CarterD/status/803760127652331520 ... 
        "Close to a thousand" is not actually a thousand.
        I'm looking for good books or papers on the Liberty League of the 1930s. Any suggestions?
        Union President at Carrier given no information about deal: "We're trying to figure out what the hell is going on."https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/29/donald-trump-has-reached-a-deal-with-a-manufacturer-to-keep-jobs-from-going-to-mexico/?utm_term=.aa4455d82005 ... 
        Getting a special tax deal from Indiana in exchange for moving 2,000 jobs to Mexico rather than all 3,000 seems like a pretty good deal.
        Does the Carrier sort-of-deal also include the Rexnord plant down the road also moving to Mexico?http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-indiana-carrier-analysis-20161129-story.html ... 
        Unclear what the Carrier thing really means. Workers still have no details. But the bar is very low.https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/trumps-showdown-with-manufacturer-exposes-obamas-weakness-on-outsourcing/ ... 
        So the workers whose jobs are at stake are in the dark as to details, getting their info from the same headlines their plight generated.
