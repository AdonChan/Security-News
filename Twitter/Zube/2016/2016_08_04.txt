        I'm becoming suspicious that @FiveThirtyEight is just drawing a fish, not making predictions.pic.twitter.com/bmatv9kyra
        What always surprises me is the sheer number of people who think that policy is totally unrelated to politics.
        It just seems obvious that people suit their political behavior to the strength or weakness of democracy.
        Access to courts, ability to strike, sue, get medical care, right to property, freedom from monopoly, etc - the whole suite not just voting.
        I don't get the argument that none of this matters, that voting patterns and cultural beliefs are totally unaffected by any of this.
        The most powerful example is the foreclosure crisis. It hit tens of millions. Yet, basically unacknowledged as a meaningful political event.
        14 million+ Americans losing their biggest financial asset & where they live, you'd think would scar a nation somehttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/760885728909914113 ... 
        Another powerful example is the incredible success of the New Deal political economy framework in creating a much stronger democracy.
        The Democrats lost two Congressional House elections from 1930-1994. Two. That's it.
        There are always lots of factors that go into political outcomes but a near total discount of the impact of policy on people's lives is odd.
        Read this piece for a great narrative on how the New Deal framework created much more regional equality.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novdec-2015/bloom-and-bust/ ... 
        @matthewstoller I've been telling an anecdote in my book talk. I interviewed the director of 99 Homes last year. I asked how he prepared (1)
        @matthewstoller he said he looked @ film history 2 find depictions of foreclosure. He had to go back to The Grapes of Wrath (1939) to find 1
        Political journalists have a really hard time covering this intersection for some reason. Maybe it's editors. Perhaps habit.
        For instance whenever you watch a debate, questions from voters are almost always policy related, but journalists often ask horse race Qs.
        Not always true, of course. There are many great political journalists and there is a place for horse race coverage. Personalities matter.
        It just seems like policy is often a really big deal. Like Clinton released an autism plan. That's important. I want to know about it.
        @matthewstoller it wasn't just invisible politically but culturally. People in FC were isolated, humiliated and shamed.
        It just seems like there's a general lack of confidence in evaluating what our democracy is doing. So fallback is nihilism.
        @matthewstoller Can't tell you how many times been told by media "love yr book but not tied to the election." Yes it is!

        This story is astonishing. Take a break from the accident scene that is Trump to read it: https://theintercept.com/2016/08/03/gop-lawyer-chinese-owned-company-us-presidential-politics/ ... https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/760889321029242881 ...

        Sean and Hanno's GCM talk, third floor, Island I, 11.30. Go see it.
        South Seas IJ. Small room. Great talk.
        This is quite possibly the best HN comment of all time. pic.twitter.com/RP85hLYMLf
        Sean and Hanno's slide deck has been injected into a TLS session at http://CAREERS.MI5.GOV.UK .
        Don't use GCM.
        It's not a 2016 conference talk unless you scanned the whole Internet.pic.twitter.com/k9T2xQrkQo

        I should be clear: this is only happening on a small number of vulnerable servers!

        TLS 1.3 redesigns to mitigate this problem. But your hand rolled protocol won't! Use something else besides GCM.pic.twitter.com/rGE6jAhHQ3
        72.4% sure Sean just invented a new GCM attack just trying to answer a dudes question.
        (a possible error oracle variant of the attack, extended similarly to Thai and Juliano's attack)
        Really impressed with the questions on this talk. People clearly paid attention.
        Nothing like the vendor area of a commercial security conference like BH or RSA to make me question my life choices.
        This was a great talk. I think maybe one of my all-time favorites. Congrats Hanno Aaron and Sean!
