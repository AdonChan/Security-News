        Just did the unthinkable... Reported a kernel vulnerability directly to Apple's product security team 
        Let me correct that... It is a kernel driver vulnerability - let's not confuse terms.
        . @iDebeon if you want to get paid to fix Apple bugs apply for a job at Google or Yahoo
        . @qwertyoruiopz just wait until you see what i reported 
        Well that GSMagic team should not have posted a jb video. Otherwise i might not have reported this bug...
        People do not realize i was joking. That GSMagic team is just a fake, no need to kill their bug.

        Sunday evening on a bank holiday weekend. The existential dread can be put on hold for 24 hours.
        Oh shit, I forgot to watch 'Top Gear' for the last 15 years.

        'The One Show' is on TV. The sound is muted. I can only assume among the gaudy colours of the set they are discussing the duality of man.
        Now here's Gyles Brandreth looking like a man you'd avoid at a bus stop using fruit as an analogy for existential ennui.
        "I've come to a restaurant in London's West End," I imagine Gyles is saying, "to compare a banana to an inescapable feeling of dread."
        Now here's Alex Jones with, no doubt, a thoughtful meditation on the BBC's new cookery show and the traumatic nature of existence.
        "Life is pain," Alex says, her face etched with experience. "But one of the best ways to take your mind off pain is with Italian cooking."
        TV idea: existential baking show  called 'Loaf of Dread'.

        curious if anybody has tried calculating AES keys in AD by hand.  Curious if the salt listed in ms-kile is correct cc:@gentilkiwi @PyroTek3
        Ok, so here's an example of overpass the hash using the Kali kerberos utils.  Thanks @gentilkiwi  for the assist!pic.twitter.com/NRTKwvziZU
        note, this is using heimdall, which I believe is the default kerberos version being used, the ktutil command for MIT kerb is diff
        So why is this useful?  I've been to several locations lately that used centrify to manage MAC / Unix assets, which uses AD + kerb
        so if you have dumped the domain, you can create kerb tickets to ssh into centrify controlled boxes
        I need several of these.https://twitter.com/RayDavidson/status/737057679118630916 ...
