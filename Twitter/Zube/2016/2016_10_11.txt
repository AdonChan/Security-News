        Trump is a vile, misogynistic piece of shit. And clearly he shadowed Hillary to project whatever physical intimidation he could muster.
        But I think that Hillary wasn't the slightest bit intimidated. She's not only tougher than Trump, but also most of her followers.pic.twitter.com/p3IMi0nBWq
        I've always been puzzled by how many of her followers are anxious and afraid. You'd think they'd tap into the Clinton cutthroat vibe.

        If the people around you brag about sexual assault, guess what, that's not normal, you just make friends with perpetrators of sexual assault
        "Oh that's just a guy thing, guys just brag about sexual assault."
        This may be a surprise to you, that your friends are pieces of shit, which is why you seem to so eagerly defend Trump: to stay deluded.
        "My friends aren't pieces of shit, they're good people! Good people brag about sexual assault sometimes."
        You stay in your shitty world with your shitty friends bemoaning the world calling you all a bunch of deplorable assholes who hurt women.
        I'm going to bed, and you're going to walk away thinking I'm the wrong one.

        .@realDonaldTrump, here is Dylan Roof, a radical Christian terrorist. How come you & your good christians didn't report him? #debatepic.twitter.com/RZ99ITEpTS
        What. Is. He. Doing.pic.twitter.com/6uE8sf09ul
        Maybe smarter to just acknowledge that no president can bring together everyone? Or ever has?
        This pretense that there are no deplorable Americans is weird.
        How is this over in 7 minutes and no climate change, no women's health, no Black Lives Matter? #debate
        I'm glad the earth isn't getting too hot for life as we know it otherwise I'd be sad the topic doesn't come up in presidential debates
        Are you not entertained?
        Wish she'd just said, "He was very entertaining on Celebrity Apprentice." And sat down.
        For liberals unhappy about "I'd prosecute you," are you happy Obama DOJ didn't prosecute Bush/Cheney and other torturers?
        HILLARY: i told you he'd fuck the chair
        I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.  #debate
        To recap: the GOP nominee chided Goldman Sachs, denounced the Iraq/Libya wars, reprimanded the Gulf States, and called for detente w/ Russia
        Is the problem that a candidate threatened to jail another candidate? Or is it candidates can never be jailed? Also applies to Bush/Cheney?
        Decorum problem, check. Personal vendetta stench, check. But much of the commentary going beyond this to imply "no jail for powerful pols."
        Depressing, but @jeremyscahill nails it: Clinton's neolib, neocon policies obscured by the Trump shit show
        Think @tnyCloseRead gets close to the heart of the matter of what's so disturbing about Trump's jail threat
        In post-debate coverage, CBS News's Bob Schieffer has some remarks about a certain candidate:pic.twitter.com/Zwlq6QnarU
        Whatever the size of Trump's base, seems impervious to the decrees of just about every establishment politician, publication, & institution.
        Feels a little weird that Billy Bush was suspended and Trump still gets to run for president.

        It's like whatever medication he was on wore off at about 21 minutes in.
        The great democratic tradition of jailing your opponent.
        Trump is this close to threatening to jail the moderator.
        "Extreme vetting" sounds like a reality show in which you jump out of a plane while performing surgery on a Labrador.
        "I pay tremendous numbers of taxes"
        Maybe a pro-wresling debate format wasn't such a great idea after all.
        I love the @SFBART twitter feed.https://twitter.com/SFBART/status/785300514204286976 ... 
        Osmosis.
        Did Trump just accuse Clinton of tweeting at 3am?
        First 20 minutes of debate were Twitter for iPhone, then it switched to Twitter for Android.
        Could have been worse. There could have been cyber questions.
        I agree with the smart people in my feed who think this debate changed nothing.
        If you came in with strong feelings about either candidate, there was plenty to reinforce it. No particular surprises about either.
        One way the debate COULD be relevant is whether it influences prominent  Trump's supporters who might be on the fence about abandoning him.
        The influential supporters need to be reassured he won't get more reckless/have more scandals. I can't tell; my perspective too different.
        With things like last night's debate, political engagement feels more degrading than empowering. It's going to be a long month.
        The debate was like a dramatic reading of the comments section.
        When Trump said admitting to a sex crime on tape doesn't necessarily mean you did it, he was talking about the Central Park Five, right?
        Ken Bone made history as the first male to go on TV for a complex policy issue and spark a national discussion about what he was wearing.
        I look forward to after the election, when I can go back to just being called a stupid moron for my opinions, instead of a dumbass libtard.

        It really should be made more clear that a no fly zone in Syria could lead to war with Russia. Not just casually use it as a slogan #debate
        What happened in the 1990s was a stock market bubble induced by a strong dollar policy.
        Clinton says she wants to shift the Supreme Court away from its pro-big business posture. That's not how Dems used to talk about the court.
        Here's Kerry in 2004: "The Supreme Court is just one vote away from outlawing a woman's right to choose." http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/20/election.scotus/ ... 
        It's a huge deal that Clinton argues political economy is what's at stake with the balance on the Supreme Court.
        Bernie Sanders is the clear winner of this #Debate.
        I want to hear Trump say "the lateenos" again b/c you can see in his brain he thinks he's clever and culturally sensitive as he says it.
        Clinton is really praising the Trump family nanny.
        I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.  #debate
        I don't understand why people care about Trump disagreeing with Pence rather than a possible nuclear war with Russia. But that's just me.
        The only thing that genuinely scared me tonight was the cavalier treatment of nuclear weapons and war.
        So how either candidate 'did' in this debate will be irrelevant in three days when the next awful thing Trump said/did comes out.

        Trump saying 'it's just locker room talk' is so so wrong for a lot of reasons. One minor reason is that it implies he exercises.

        There seems to be a lot of fixation after a presidental debate deciding who "won", which is entirely missing the point imo
        Hillary Clinton is not very good at concealing her perpetual astonishment that her opponent appears to be a cartoon character.
        I don't have time to follow US politics closely. So would be good if next debate starts with a "PREVIOUSLY, ON AMERICA" story catch-up

        Let's be clear: a candidate for president promised to put his opponent in jail if he wins. Everything else is secondary.
        Trump disagreed with his running mate to praise the dictator who's trying to interfere with our election. 
        This was tweeted during the debate *by the former chairman of the Republican National Committee*.https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele/status/785290342807379968 ... 
        Trump's *vocabulary* was that of "locker room talk." Not what he said with it. Big difference.
        (And even the vocabulary was pretty extreme.)

        Hillary Clinton gets props for not tearing Trump's head off.  Especially when he was stalking her onstage.
        Donald Trump should have kicked dirt on Anderson Cooper's leg to get the best effect out of his ump bashing.
        Never has there been such a specter of potential physical violence at a debate. It felt like a WWE event teaser.
        Remember when George H W Bush checked watch during the town hall debate? Somebody should have told Trump to do that, but with eye rolls.
        This whole thing has been like a wet dream David Lynch had after he fell asleep watching Fox.  Goodnight, America, and good luck. #debate
        While I may not be able to moderate a debate, sounds like Mike Pence and Donald Trump might need to come on my show to talk things out.

        Bob Schieffer is pretty angry.  Said Trump threat to jail Hillary reminded him of a banana republic.  #debate
        Trump flat out threatened to "direct" attorney general to prosecute Hillary if he wins. Because that's the tradition of the Iron Islands.
        In a normal election, threatening to jail your opponent would lose you the election. This election, it's just Trump. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
