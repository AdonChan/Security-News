        I'm an anti-21st century reactionary. I hate this century so far. It's fucking awful.
        And as much as I'd like to chase you off my lawn, clad in robe and waving a rake, that's not what this is about.
        Advertising is a disease. It's fucking everywhere and cheapens everything.You can't read an article without having to endure ads.
        And it's not even good advertising.
        Politics are the worst I've ever seen it. Hillary versus Trump? Jesus in Heaven, seriously? How can that not make you ill?
        Online "debate" is anything but. People spew shit that's pumped into their heads. Arguments are at best ankle deep. Don't wear white shoes.
        Again, love those you love. Deeply. That's pretty much all we have left. Maybe that's all we ever had.
        Had a bit of a meltdown yesterday. It happens. I used to smash furniture, but now I bang keyboards. Baby steps to a better me.
        This is such a beautiful thing. I deeply love comedy.http://bit.ly/1m3xt4F

        UPDATE: Symantec has patched some of the bugs through its automatically-delivered updates, no client patch required https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20160516_00 ... 
        The reporter of the Symantec bugs, @taviso, indicates some of them will require a client patch, but I'm unclear on the severity of those.
        @SwiftOnSecurity Remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on Windows or root on Mac/Linux/UNIX.
        Thank you @taviso! So it looks like companies will need to be deploying a big update to all clients to fix this. A tall proposition.
        Context: Because antivirus suites are so DEEPLY hooked into OS functions, there are an incredible array of problems their bugs can cause.

        I toyed with calling my upcoming Antarctic thing 'Voyage to the End of the World', but found a title that's SO MUCH BETTER. Eat it, Franzen!
        Truthers crowdfunding something that won't happen. This should be a good one.https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/september-11th-redux#/ ... 
        New Yorker editor: this is great material, Franzen, but could you prepend 5000 words about your family history before you mention penguins?
        Franzen's girlfriend: "this is beautiful, honey, but could you refer to me as 'the Californian'? I don't like people knowing we're a couple"
        I've hated Franzen's prose for years because of stupid shit he writes about the Internet, and this is an exciting opportunity to branch out
        The science in the Franzen thing is horrible. He cites trends on the Antarctic peninsula as if they held for the continent, which they don't
        If anybody knows someone who was on the Lindblad cruise with Franzen, I would love to talk to them about the experience
        Playing bridge, citing Beckett and Mann, jump starting a car, getting an Argentine visa for his brother--Franzen brings the Antarctic to life
        This is making me rethink everything I have left to write about Antarctica. Did you know my grandma worked in a hosiery factory? Buckle up.
        @baconmeteor Isn't this the guy who pondered adopting a child from Africa so he could understand the plight of the continent?

        Franzen should disclose what Lindblad paid him for the slogan "How much better it was to be bored and frozen by seawatching than to be dead"

        When we develop the exploit for CANVAS, we saw there was a HUGE amount of vulnerable devices all around (.br seems to  have at least 300k)
        The vulnerability was patched a year ago, but it was worm up a couple of days ago.
        The bug itself it's a pre-auth file upload. Here is a list of people freaking out on the ubiquity forum: http://community.ubnt.com/t5/airMAX-General-Discussion/Virus-attack-URGENT-UBNT/td-p/1562940 ...

        Ugh. Waking up to the news that Elsevier acquired SSRN makes me want to go back to bed.
        Seriously, this is a huge step backwards. It's precisely predatory behavior by the likes of Elsevier that makes SSRN so valuable.

        Asked what users would do when the BBC's recipes were removed, Whittingdale said, "Let them eat cake! But only if it's bought from a shop."
        I think my nose is putting on weight.
        Recipes.
        I'm ambivalent about the BBC, but some of today's announced cuts to services could only be described as "cunty".
        If today has proved anything it's that extremists wanting to generate real terror should start destroying recipes.
        "Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombing of a carbonara recipe in Tunbridge Wells today which inconvenienced 14 people."
        "A spokesperson for the local residents' association condemned the bombing, saying it was an "awful waste of fair trade artisan linguine"."
        I might need counselling after that poo.
        Flumps like Boris and Dave peddling their own beliefs as best for the country and using lies to influence the ignorant is top-end bleak.
        "I remember when cauliflowers came in bunches of 10 or more!" Boris howls. "The cauliflower man would come every morning! Damn the EU!"
        "The local Co-op would have parrots piled high for sixpence a dozen." Boris continues. "Now parrots are only sold alive. The EU DID THAT!"
        "FUCKING BANANAS!" Boris suddenly yelps, as though in great emotional pain. "I hate bananas. Hate them. Stupid yellow potassium bastards!"
        "Remember when we fought Hitler and his plan to reduce the number of bananas in a bunch?" BoJob shrieks. "My dad was a banana in that war!"
