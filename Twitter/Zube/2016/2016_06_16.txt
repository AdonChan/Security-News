        This Mister Trump appears by all accounts to be a loutish rake. 
        Behold, his ignorance! Such a feeble mind would not a full meal make. #19thCenturyAntiTrumpTweets
        Mister Trump is no gentleman; his unbridled tongue races toward the nearest absurdity. #19thCenturyAntiTrumpTweets
        History may not remember his name, but it will surely bear his scars. #19thCenturyAntiTrumpTweets

        In the wake of Orlando, the election has quickly become a contest between the proven war criminal, and the amateur wannabe war criminal.
        Any country where the NFL is the national sport and the choice for president is b/w two pro-war candidates isn't about to give up its guns.
        This election is imagine versus pretend. Let's imagine what Trump might do, and let's pretend what Hillary didn't do.

        The truth is, we know so little about life, we don't really know what the good news is and what the bad news is.
        Plato says that the unexamined life is not worth living. But what if the examined life turns out to be a clunker as well?
        Life happens too fast for you ever to think about it. If you could just persuade people of this, but they insist on amassing information.
        I think William Shakespeare was the wisest human being I ever heard of. To be perfectly frank, though, that's not saying much.
        Ideas or the lack of them can cause disease.
        I really wonder what gives us the right to wreck this poor planet of ours.

        With "proper" exploits taking months to build, and attacking construction becoming a very specialized niche field, how many defenders ...
        ... still understand a modern attack, top to bottom? How many defensive orgs would give their defenders 6 months to study up on them?
        It looks like asymptotically, most defenders will not understand an attack any more. How can this be addressed?

        With "proper" exploits taking months to build, and attacking construction becoming a very specialized niche field, how many defenders ...
        ... still understand a modern attack, top to bottom? How many defensive orgs would give their defenders 6 months to study up on them?
        It looks like asymptotically, most defenders will not understand an attack any more. How can this be addressed?

        So what is the tl;dr about ios 10?
        So who has a jailbroken ios 10 device? I am will not for a while... Cause canada
        Apparently the new iBoot unlocking feature of iOS 10 costs only 433 USD per device.
        So @aloria makes up an iboot unlock in ios 10. A few people tweet nonsense about it and everyone believes it is real. Welcome to internet.

        Well trustzone ~~ EL3
        I wonder how many banking apps etc. will stop working in iOS 10 because their jailbreakdetection sees xpcd_cache.dylib
        You know how cool it would be for IDA to support Aarch64 system register names out of the box?
        Public untethered jailbreaks need to chain 5-10 vulns together is used as a security argument by that Apple dude. Who cares when half of ...
        ... These bugs are previously not correctly fixed bugs. Also it does not require an untethered jailbreak to pwn all your data/life.
        Untethers are for people who actually need to reboot their phones.

        I've separated the core system from the minimal and optimal routes - minimal was intended to be a significantly cheaper system
        There's a few bits where it's not entirely clear what the routing was intended to be (Sausalito,Walnut Creek, and so on) - fixes welcome!
        Ok so the brexit campaign is actually a false flag operation to destroy the value of GBP and allow Europe to just buy the UK?
        No movement is important enough that someone's contributions can outweigh their abuse of others
        Defend one abuser because they have good politics and other abusers will realise they can get the same cover by aligning themselves with you
        So if you're defending someone because they're useful to your cause, you're building a structure that will perpetuate further abuse
        And, eventually, you'll no longer have a cause and you'll have ruined countless lives along the way. Fuck that.

        So if you're defending someone because they're useful to your cause, you're building a structure that will perpetuate further abuse
        Managing heat on a percolator when you've got the grounds too fine is an interesting task.

        So that'd be those extrajudicial watchlists without any kind of oversight?
        Kind of going from the frying pan to the fire when you allow a single agency to make decisions like that without checks and balances.
        "But does that mean you disagree with terror watchlists?"
        Secret policing in -general- is a bad thing, IMO.
        The inherent problem with such is that it's too easy for a Richelieu to make use of such things for their own individual gains.
        Does publicity of watchlist criteria and proper oversight risk people 'gaming the system'? Sure.
        But "better a thousand guilty go free than one innocent be harmed."
        That is, after all, a major driver behind the principle of presumed innocence - "innocent until proven guilty" - that we have here.
        Extrajudicial watchlists are a presumption of guilt, but without any proof.
        And as such, blatantly disregard the principle of presumed innocence. 
        That they are in use is a very nasty commentary on a grave overreach by the federal gov't.
        They're a powerful tool, to be sure.
        If you want to restrict firearms purchases by persons suspected of criminal activity, then do so, but do not use extrajudicial watchlists.
        And if you do so, then you MUST implement some process by which an appeal can be made.
        To restrict an action without appeal is unjust, regardless of what the action is.

        I mean, cats can be dicks but at least when they are they look cute doing it.
        What a happy coincidence that The Sun's views on the EU referendum match those of its proprietor.
        Read @carrozo's timeline for today from "Hey" onwards, about the massacre of LGBT people in Orlando.
        By their next Euro 16 match I imagine the Russian hooligans will have a tank, which Putin will deny all knowledge of.
        Mild thunder here, more like God letting off a quiet one in polite company than tuning an orchestra with a series of morning duvet rattlers.
        Clement Freud, eh. A knighted politician. What a turn up for the books.
        Remember, even though things seem awful right now, they're only going to get worse, and death is a lot farther off than you might think.
        Just eight days to go until the country decides if it's completely fucking doomed or only largely fucking doomed.
        If you're a poor white racist you're as despised by Johnson, Gove, Cameron and Osborne as any immigrant. They just need you for #Brexit.
        Once the referendum's over, regardless of the outcome, the government will come for you, not because you're racist, but because you're poor.
        Nigel Farage is dressed as a 17th century naval officer and sailing a slave ship up the Thames in the name of taking Britain forward.
        The Remain lot should have organised a flyby of Eurofighters and told Farage to stick his flotilla up his arse.
        There hasn't been this much attention paid to a cunt on a boat since Robert Maxwell.
        Farage is now standing on the prow of his ship reading aloud a declaration from a scroll. Some of the language he's using is quite shocking.
        "Would you like to come below deck with me and polish my brass fittings?"pic.twitter.com/jRjwZjC63E
        I'm genuinely struggling to accept this flotilla is genuine and not a sitcom starring Keith Barron and Peter Bowles as yacht club rivals.
        This is the day of days; the day in which Britain proved itself to be nothing more than a fucking Carry On film.
        Nigel Farage: Kenneth Williams; Bob Geldof: Sid James; Iain Duncan Smith: Bernard Bresslaw; Michael Gove: Charles Hawtrey; Boris: Joan Sims.
        Farage should be on a tug boat, because he's a wanker.
        Hearing elitist self-serving upper class right wing millionaires claim to be on the side of the people is enough to radicalise a nun.
