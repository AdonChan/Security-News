+         This is true no matter who wins and who loses. It's not a partisan issue
+ .
+         This is also not just an issue for presidential races. There's a signifi

+         Indisputably true that our e-voting systems are woefully insecure. We kn
+ ow much less, however, about how/if they're attacked in practice. 1/
+         Before this year, hasn't been much evidence of actual attempted attacks
+ against these systems; surprising given how insecure they are. 2/
+         We don't yet know if that's still true; a proper audit could shed light
+ on that. At some point, the e-voting honeymoon will end. 3/
+         Also, exploitation need not actually alter the result; disruption of ele
+ ction or doubt on the result may be good enough for attacker. 4/
+         The bottom line is we need to secure these systems *before* we cross tha
+ t tipping point, assuming we haven't already. 5/5
+         BTW, "Diebold" takes the bulk of the public criticism for insecure votin
+ g machines, but every vendor that's been examined has similar probs.
+         Also, there's never been credible evidence of DELIBERATE backdoors in th
+ ese systems. But backdoors would be redundant, they're so insecure.
+         All that said, there's much more to election integrity than just the sec
+ urity of voting machine software.
+         I guess the CIA finally got to Castro.
+         I want to see a proper technical forensic audit, not because I think it
+ will change election, but because we need the insight it will give.
