        Unearthing old notebooks and files. Found most of my '95 Letterman submission. Not bad. Still some good stuff, but dated.
        I really want to find my '84 Letterman packet. Much more conceptual and closer to the bone.

RegexTip

        Inside a character class, dash means range. For example, [0-9] matches any digit. Outside a character class dash has no special meaning.
        Inside a character class, period and question mark are not special. For example, [.?] matches a period or a question mark.
        Inside a character class, ^ means 'not'. For example, [^abc] matches any character except a, b, or c.
        Outside a character class, ^ means 'start at the beginning of a line'. Example: /^The/ matches lines that begin with 'The'.
        $ anchors a regular expression at the end of a strings. Example: /end$/ matches strings ending in 'end'.
        (When a string contains newline characters, whether $ may match the end of the line or the end of the string depends on regex settings.)
        THE book on regular expressions is Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey Friedlhttp://bit.ly/6CY6Ub 
        Just what do you mean by "number"? http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/04/18/just-what-do-you-mean-by-number/ ... 
        \s matches white space, i.e. space, tab, newline, etc. Example: /foot\s+ball/ matches 'foot ball'  but not 'football'.
        \S matches anything but white space, i.e. \S is the opposite of \s.  This is a common pattern with upper case vs lower case.
        \d matches any digit, i.e. [0-9]. \D matches anything except a digit, i.e. [^0-9].
        \w matches any 'word' character, i.e. letters, numbers, and underscore. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
        \W matches any non-word character, anything \w doesn't match.
        Reminder: * means zero or more, + means one or more, ? means zero or one.
        .@RegexTip is brought to you by http://JohnDCook.com pic.twitter.com/ykLS3To6CK
        Parentheses and | denote options. Example: /(red|green|blue) truck/ matches 'red truck' or 'green truck' or 'blue truck'.
        Parentheses have the side effect of capturing, setting \1 to the stuff matched by the first set of parentheses, \2 to the second, etc.
        *, +, and ? are considered greedy quantifiers. They are going to consume matching tokens before moving on to the next atom.
        vi and vim's engine uses \+ and \= in place of the more common + and ?.
        'Perl Best Practices' recommends always using /xms on regexes. /x to allow whitespace & comments, /m and /s to handle newlines as expected.

        The use of COM Scriplet Execution Bypass via regsvr32
        
        So...Just so you all know...There is also this tool call InstallUtil.exe, and RegASM, and IEExec. Just so we are all now on the same page
        
        @subTee @AlecRWaters @aionescu it passes the url to scrobj to dllinstall. But regsvr will take a sct url and auto load scrobj for you.
        
        This works for regsvr32 as well: https://twitter.com/Lee_Holmes/status/701894694171594753 ...  #DFIR

        Stripe's "group yes/no" promise for team interviews is pretty hollow, unless they're pledging not to recruit directly afterwards.
        But they're not promising that, because that would be stupid and counterproductive. I'm interested in how they get around this.
        For folks wondering why mentions of Serious Eats and Food Lab are blocked on /r/food, here's as much as I know:https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/4gcgth/serious_eats_banned_from_rfood/d2gsu5j ... 
        If u post a photo to /r/food of food u made from my recipes, go ahead+paste recipe into comments w/out source. Better that people can learn.
        When Reddit is good, it's better than almost anything else. But when it's bad it's a sky-blackening tire fire.
