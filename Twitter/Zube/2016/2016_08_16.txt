        One problem with e-voting debate is loudest voices are often crackpots who think a particular election was stolen. Obscures genuine issues.
        The effect is voting security is an incredibly difficult, frustrating space to make progress in. Has driven many very smart people away.

        What is annoying is the social scientists who didn't see political chaos coming confidently pronouncing why it's here.
        I noted in 2012 the rise of both authoritarian politics and populist politics as a consequence of the housing crash. http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&context=ulj ... 
        This didn't take tremendous insight, it required reading history and talking to people who had been kicked out of neoliberal policy circles.
        Or to put it another way, when 6-8M homes go into foreclosure, maybe that's a signal something is very wrong.
        And when it takes social scientists years to notice this, maybe this suggests there's something wrong with modern social science.
        The basic frame - which every realtor intuitively knew - is that the 20th century American social contract was delivered through housing.
        It's the way the Fed and banks connected to the economy. It was our source of savings and communities. It was stimulus and inflation control
        Snap that basic spine, that basic connection b/n a large chunk of the public and the elite class, and political chaos ensues. Obvious!
        Also, from 2005-2011, sentient beings noticed the Iraq disaster, Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party and a giant financial crisis.
        @matthewstoller Or, if you like foamy runways, very very right.
        The historical roots of this aren't obvious, and the details of the collapse aren't obvious. But THAT it was happening was.
        Not all social science, of course. Economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case did critical work on white mortality rates.
        Deaton/Case data suggests that the social collapse actually started in the late 1990s, which is fascinating.
        This is imprecise. There have always been zones that are authoritarian and zones that aren't.https://twitter.com/SusanofTexas/status/765227543276335104 ... 
        For example. A middle class suburban white straight man in the 1950s lived in a democracy, a closeted man did not.
        These zones are always in flux, contracting and expanding and shifting depending on social, economic, cultural factors.
