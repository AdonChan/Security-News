        Bundy crazies starting to face actual consequences. https://twitter.com/FBI/status/705523531245821953 ... 
        Baseless conspiracy theory: All amicus signers are being put on a list of experts conscripted in future all writs orders to crack iPhones.
        I go offline for 2 hours and something about cyber pathogens in the San Bernardino phone now? Internet, next time I'm hiring a sitter.
        Wait, that CNN headline isn't a parody?
        Cyber pathogens are so unspeakably dangerous that the open research community has wisely never published a single paper about them.
        Now I'm actually being scolded for being part of a conspiracy to keep the dangers of cyber pathogens from the public.
        Now that the dangers of cyber pathogens are finally being recognized, it's time we face the other elephant in the cyberroom: cyber cooties.
        It seems unwise to give someone who's defensive about the size of his, um, fingers, access to nuclear weapons.
        While we're laughing about cyber pathogens, ISIS is busy weaponizing cyber isotopes.

        The nonsensical "cyberpathogen" argument suggests the DA had no access to, or chose not to consult, actual experts who could have helped.
        "Cyberpathogen" neatly sums up the underlying problem with the case. The authorities aren't willing or able to do technical heavy lifting.
        Lack of investigative tech expertise and capability is a difficult but solvable problem, and does not require vendors to weaken security.
        Much fun has been poked at "dormant cyber pathogen," but raises a serious question. How can we regulate what we understand poorly? All tech.
        It's similar to Ted Stevens' "series of tubes". We knew he meant "pipes", but it still revealed a fundamental lack of understanding.
        20 yrs ago, USG said HW attacks against Clipper (which had anti-RE features lacking in iPhone 5c) were feasible with resources of nat'l lab.
        ... so this idea that hardware attacks are something the government never thought of is nonsense.
