        Making discrimination by ethnicity easy and efficient is an explicitly racist act. Claiming this isn't racist is... yes, also racist.

        Somehow I've avoided systemd until recently, but now I find myself gazing into that particular madness.
        So far; a binary logger that can't be disabled, dregs of a mobile container system, namespaces oversaturated with benevolistic optimism.
        I also advise anybody that is planning to attend my keynote on Thursday to bring strong coffee, it is going to be theory-heavy.

        The right's full of people overflowing with hate & fear; their politics is an attempt to force the outside world to match their insides 1/
        The "left," or whatever it is, also has people overflowing with hate & fear, but fewer of them and it's generally less intense 2/
        I'm overflowing with hate & fear on certain days but do my best not to let it make me support bombing four-year-olds 3/
        I'm starting a new religion that's the exact opposite of Buddhism in every way possible. We're calling it "America."

        Color me unbelievably surprised that some DNS security nerd decided they should be in the middle of the Trump/Russia story.
        I rarely agree with @csoghoian and actively avoid agreeing with Rob Graham, but: yes. This is some shameful shit.https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/793410846147874816 ... 
        I'm not comfortable with Comey's choices in July or October, but they were hard calls. Zero evidence of political motive. /2
        I've admired Comey since reporting on him for ANGLER. Disagree a lot. But if that guy's rigging for Trump I'm a kangaroo. /3
        Shorter: just 3% of zones signed, .01% of them using ECDSA, 40+% of which don't validate. We're ~10 years away from 2003.https://twitter.com/reseauxsansfil/status/793421880912932864 ... 
        In fact, full device encryption (and improved crypto in general) has virtually no impact on criminal computer attacks.https://twitter.com/flamsmark/status/793475194861957120 ... 
        There are many coherent arguments for Snowden's contributions, but "protecting you from criminals" simply is not one of them.
        For consumers, cryptography basically protects you from only two things:
        This is great and important and I support it and it's sort of a big chunk of my life's work. Just let's be honest about it.
        Have you voted yet? Are you sure you can't vote today in person? You probably can. What are you waiting for? Don't wait 'til Nov 8.
        I fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia, and never make a nerd argument with a numbered list.
        More and more in my life as I get older, I find my inner voice is just Bob Belcher's resigned "oh my god", over and over.
        Merry Christmas everyone
        sure, buddy, you're gonna switch to Windows just like you were gonna move to Canada if Bush won
        Thanks, "DNS security experts". Now we get a week of false equivalence narratives.https://twitter.com/HackingDave/status/793485943411990528 ... 
        In the history of journalism no story with a lede including potential sentencing has ever been accurate.https://twitter.com/Chicagoist/status/793496867048939520 ... 
        Contra: If your whole beat is "there's no Trump/Russia connection", you can be right once in awhile w/o doing any investigative journalism.
