        On a scale of 1-10, how ironic would it be for Apple to sue FBI for patent infringement, if this technique violated IP rights?
        An exploit is always possible, but it wouldn't scale well or sustain reliably against a wide range of devices. NAND methods are more likely.

        Nothing makes coffee taste better than explaining to the beardo next to you how they are drinking liquid garbage due to over-extraction
        Of course all your effort is wasted if you haven't ensured that your water molecules are of uniform size
        Even so-called "distilled" water contains deuterium and measurable quanties of H3O+ and OH- ions, which can profoundly affect flavor

        Weird, though, how being bombed radicalized us. After 9/11: mass surveillance, kidnapping, torture, gulags, assassinations... all normalized.
        It makes me wonder whether being continuously bombed and droned might radicalize other people, too? Nah, that's crazy hippy talk. Forget it.
        Gonna post this "Martian tries to understand war/terrorism" piece every time TV Terror Experts talk radicalization
        I mean, if instead of "Terrorism Experts," TV brought on a five-year-old who said, "When people get bombed, they bomb back," HUGE progress.
        Because until you can acknowledge what any five-year-old already knows, YOU ARE NOT A FUCKING EXPERT ON ANYTHING. Least of all terrorism.

        Unlike the P0 exploit the CANVAS exploit for OS X is not hardcoded to anything in particular and will work on all versions. :)
        Flashback:  Who is the Joe?  
        @daveaitel This isn't civil litigation so notion of "discovery" isn't quite the same. Judge determines what information she needs to rule.
        @daveaitel Apple could try to convince judge that only their experts could really determine if method was feasible. But I doubt it'd work.
        @daveaitel If FBI wanted to use information obtained from phone in criminal trial, 6th amendment confrontation clause applies.
        @daveaitel But a criminal defendant holds that right, not Apple.

        FBI advocacy for bad crypto is rational if it will be blamed for unsolved crimes, but not blamed for crimes caused by lack of strong crypto.
        The crypto "debate" probably won't go away without changing the FBI's incentives to put greater weight on crime prevention.
        If nothing else, the iPhone 5c is getting one hell of a free security audit.

        Banning Muslims from the US now makes as much sense as banning Catholics from entering the US would have during the IRA Troubles.
        Surprise! Bigots think those who don't share their bigotry are stupid and naive.
        A bunch of KKK-types are quite eagerly telling me why deporting catholics would be a dumb idea. So I guess that's progress.
        No other threat in the US right now scares me as much as open, unchallenged advocacy of racism, xenophobia, torture & anti-intellectualism
