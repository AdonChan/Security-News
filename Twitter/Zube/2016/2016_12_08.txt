        27. Klain worries that criticism of a leader invites retaliation. Spoken like someone who doesn't realize most people kiss ass or get fired.
        28. So what Trump is doing with Carrier is imposing an autocratic change on an already partially autocratic system.
        29. He did save some jobs. He also conned people. The real problem is, this is the best our political system is offering.
        30. Faced with a corporate autocrat lying in corporate management speak or a political autocrat promising to save your job, who do you pick?
        31. There is no alternative. The Democrats have been in power for eight years. They deliver rule by Wall Street and UTC executives.
        32. Trump offers crumbs and cons. That's it. That's the choice. That's why this is awful and sad. But it's not just about Trump.
        33. This is fixable. We must restore our understanding in both parties of what democracy means. Both parties. Not just one you don't like.

        Privilege is being able to justify flagging stories about repression because you don't know how to deal with the arguments they cause.
        Privilege is the idea that enforcing the status quo will lead to an increase in the quality of discourse
        @mjg59 the more I think about it, these arguments sound weirdly familiar. "privilege is being able to protest instead of going to work"
        @mjg59 "why are you so OUTRAGED, are you TRIGGERED???" etc.

        Observing the 75th anniversary of #PearlHarbor today- the event that brought America finally into the war that shaped the modern world.
        After #PearlHarbor, we went to war for  4 years with the Axis. After 9/11, we went to war...forever, it seems.
