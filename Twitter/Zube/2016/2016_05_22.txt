        I wish that Windows had a mode to debug trap on system calls, and make 0x7FFE0xxx invalid memory. These would make hostile debugging easier.
        I also wish that x86 CPUs had a mode to trap on CPUID. This would make some interesting things possible.

        CORRECTION: Today I tweeted that FurAffinity was penetrated a second time. Today they learned the password hashes leaked out, so a reset.
        We have an app that is locked to Firefox 3.6. So I downloaded the portable version of it, config'd it, packaged it, and deployed shortcut.
        We have a system locked to Java 1.4.  It only acts like it needs a special version. So I edited registry to re-direct it to the normal JRE.
        We have an ActiveX control that only works in IE8 on XP. Except I found out it works great in IE11 Enterprise mode on Windows 7 x64. Solved.
        I most work in paradise or something I don't understand the compatibility horror stories I hear all the time.
        @SwiftOnSecurity you get so much leeway... both of these would've required going through DEV and QA and then the change board and approved
        @SwiftOnSecurity "not supported" just means that nobody is going to help you if you have a problem. It may quite well work.
        Sorry if I seem conceited, I just truly don't understand how it works in other orgs. Thanks for explaining the bigger world to me.

        All I know is, I'd rather be fired because the compatibility fix I made for Oracle stopped working, than support ducking Windows XP in 2016.
        When I look at Windows XP, it's like I'm looking back in time, to when millennials still thought they'd own a home some day.
        For a whole year I actually thought that Vaping was like some kind of legal marijuana, instead of a cigarette cult minus the lung cancer.
        How common is the "screw up bad, get fired on the spot, regardless of overall performance" paradigm in IT organizations? Seems like a hassle
        I hear organizations that are a total disaster if a sysadmin leaves, and I hear of organizations that just randomly fire people. Explain?
        The first sysadmin I met in my job in helpdesk once told me how he brought down email for two days, that he didn't sleep for two days fixing
        He said he was throwing up, ready to get fired once he finished. They told him not to do that again. So that was nice.
        @SwiftOnSecurity I had a boss call me while I was on a date once to say he accidentally powered off our production SAN and needed me to fix.

        @i0n1c Attempting to patch that API on jailbroken devices is probably against Apple's terms & conditions, so we can't do it.
        Duh... I thought some vuln was fixed because i had commented the exploit out 
        @i0n1c @Skype have jailbreak detection. I wish I can see this virus kicked out of the storepic.twitter.com/v1ZGYQ8Yxm

        @i0n1c I have thousands of iOS apps on file that do that.
        . @chronic yes it is pretty obvious that Apple is just discriminating SektionEins.
        Btw official appeal to Apple review board was also rejected. Apple's discrimination of our company continues.
        
        What i really don't understand is that Apple chooses bad PR over good PR because our app would show that most phones are not hacked.

        Hey guys this app you can still get in the AppStore it is not from @SektionEins so it is not discriminated againstpic.twitter.com/Hfu5Cgp89t
