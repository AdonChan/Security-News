        This is the most interesting exchange at the Congressional hearing on encryption so far @BuzzFeedNews :pic.twitter.com/0qWKAqtriA
        Idea: Let's put a bunch of non-technical nitwits in a room to discuss anti-encryption legislation.
        Eshoo: We gave #FBI $9Billion - so how did you screw up by changing the iCloud password on San Bernadino shooter's phone?
        Sewell: Within the past 2 years, the Chinese government asked Apple for source code.
        Pretty sure Congress just asked the President of RSA for free advice on how to secure the nation's power grid.
        Sewell trying to be VERY careful to avoid suggesting he's going to teach FBI how to hack phones.
        Griffith: Is there a way that maybe you guys could hold the keys, or maybe we could make the keys out of candy so we can lick them?
        Sewell made it clear that Apple's currently looking at iCloud encryption.
        Sewell describes helping find a 14-yo abducted girl within hours based off IP logs.
        New Rule: If you screw up and change the iCloud password on a terrorism case, you don't get $9 billion next year.
        I find it bizarre that Apple is getting berated for child abuse crimes, when the FBI is using computer vulns to track thousands of offenders

        @SteveD3 Yes, Stefan Metzmacher (the #badlock guy). It leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when triggering a lock request with 2730+ locks
        @ekacnet @SteveD3 There is nothing wrong with the loop in itself, the bug is caused by the cast to a 16 bit int after mul+add of lock_count.
        @ekacnet @OwariDa @jedisct1 That's a library only used by smbtorture. Real client library code uses libsmbclient which is a stable API/ABI.
        @richinseattle Ironically, I verified it by modifying smbtorture (-> crash). Seems like smbtorture is the only thing calling it though. >_<

        Fun! Open sourced CVE-2015-1805 for some Android devices (mainly Sony)https://github.com/dosomder/iovyroot ... 
        I have mixed feelings about AES-GCM-SIV. It's nonce misuse-but-not-too-many-times resistant, and can be perceived as "a static nonce is ok".
        https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/999.pdf  and HS1-SIV are more appealing, if only because they don't require specialized opcodes to be implemented securely.
        MR can be useful as a band-aid for embedded devices that can't keep a state or with a broken RNG.
        But it will still reveal repeated messages, and it will still fail after a while.

        These arguments for crypto backdoors work equally well for requiring paper shredders to include scanners. http://manhattanda.org/press-release/district-attorney-vance-nypd-crime-victims%E2%80%99-advocates-call-congress-unlockjustice ...

        The looming larger issue with this GSE tale is how Fannie and Freddie will be reorganized - and if the big banks are the beneficiaries.
        Nobody has asked the leading presidential candidates what they hope to do with the GSEs. Should be a campaign issue.

        I want this issue over so I can stop seeing this dumb hashtag. #UnlockJustice #UnleashTheRainbow #Skittles #Crypto
        Sorry, for the last 15 min I was under the impression that "UnlockJustice" was the hash tag "our" side had come up with. I blame Javascript.
        At least putting scanners in shredders would be something we'd actually know how to do.
