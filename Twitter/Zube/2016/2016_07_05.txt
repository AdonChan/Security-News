        Because i get repeatedly asked:our App got sold 60k times before Apple killed it to bully us. 60k was enough to be #1 worldwide for 2-3 days
        That means it is in the reach of many players to get malicious code into app store and position it at #1 worldwide
        God my typing quality is directly proportional to the amount of beer i drink.
        Get users to download an executable .py script and codesigning doesn't stop it.
        If you make 500.000 usd a day from android malware, do you really believe a 99 USD cert requirement is out of reach?
        The reason why codesigning in AppStores seems to be more secure is cause criminals attack cheapest target. Once everyone uses CS - game over
        IMHO most attempts of security by raising attacker costs are equivalent of not needing to outrun the bear as long there are slower targets

        I celebrate July 4th and I love America. Still the American Revolution, like the French Revolution it spurred, was morally complex.
        It was a grassroots uprising and there was strong working class support that pushed elites into revolt.
        There had been a series of populist rebellions on the west part of the colonies known as the 'wars of regulation'.
        Shays Rebellion, Fries's Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion were all working class rebellions in this line.
        And were put down by elites who had worked with the working class against the British.
        At the same time, the frontier working class were often far more aggressive on subjugating Native-Americans than Eastern elites.
        I'm still learning about 1790s slavery b/c the slave economy of the 1790s was so so different than the 1850s.
        Abolitionism was popular during the revolutionary era. Virginia fought with Georgia at the Const. convention. No one expected King Cotton.
        Aaron Burr fans note that Burr really was a strong abolitionist, unlike most of the other founders, and had Southern allies.
        Cotton gin, invented in 1792, allowed for use of varieties of cotton grown inland. Without, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas aren't slave states.
        In 1790s, Hamilton thought American cotton was inferior, would just die out. England didn't really use much American cotton in 1790s.
        By mid-1800s, situation is totally different. Southern planters were equivalent to modern billionaires. Richest men in the country.
        Then of course, back to revolutionary era, the period after the war and before the const. convention was also complex.
        And the American reaction to the French Revolution was fascinating. Before the Star-Spangled Banner there was (sort of) the Marseillaise.
        Lots of different class, racial, ethnic divisions AND alliances. Big arguments about liberty, nature of man, wealth, etc.
        I like the culture that emerged. Egalitarian democratic culture with a penchant for royal celebrity fetishizing. Institutions are harder.
        Today there's lots of politically constructed poverty along with amazing innovation and wonder.
        Anyway, Happy July 4th. This is a tremendous experiment in self-government. It is our time to form a more perfect Union.
        Thats crazy!!!! KD in GSW???? .... R they gonna score 200 points a game
        I see that the #NBA has officially turned on CHEAT mode. #Warriors
        It's July 4th, the day every year when libertarians point at park signs with firework safety rules as evidence we still have a King.

        I would love to do a podcast on "Linux in Space" with someone from NASA or SpaceX. Which Linux sysadmins could I contact there?
        Full disclosure: I had the title "Linux in Space" before I had any realistic plan of making that happen. Twitter, to the rescue!
        (because damn it would be super cool to be able to make that episode)
        Hi @standaloneSA, can I talk to you on a podcast? :-)

        Argentina's new e-voting law literally punishes with jail time, among other things, "showing knowledge in computers" near the vote machines.
        Last but not least, the new e-vote law in Argentina punishes independent bug finding with jail time. Only the govt. can audit the machines.

        The defense for this kind of thing often ends up being "They don't misbehave in *this* project", which is very like "But they do good work"
        "Could this still happen in my community" is a good question to ask, and if the answer is yes a good followup is "How do we fix this"
        Because seriously broad community tolerance for people who spend their spare time engaged in racist harassment campaigns is a bad look
