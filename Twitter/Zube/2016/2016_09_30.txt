        You know, double-free/invalid-free bugs could be trivially eliminated with an ABI having fat pointers.
        At malloc time, assign an unpredictable, non-reusable 64-bit ID to the allocation and return it as part of the pointer value.
        Non-malloc pointers have arbitrary (e.g. all zero bits). Now free can trap if the id in the fat pointer doesn't match the pointed-to block.

        systemd has one denial of service after months or maybe years and half of the internet cries.where are you when openssl has 5 CVEs per week?
        there are bigger and more important projects to care about. For example libtiff. Libtiff has over 20 unfixed CVEs since 2 years..
        libtiffs website was orphaned, code was lost, the main developer stopped working on it. It's a big chaos.
        amd do you know what? libtiff is a dependency for nearly _every_ graphical sh*t out there.. GTK, chrome, firefox.. and nobody cares.

        pic.twitter.com/m4W6LBGs5a
        It's macabre our species can produce unlimited resources, but our intelligence saddles us with the complex discontent to hate it.
        There's poetry in biology finding a way to punish those who find themselves most able to transcend it.
        @SwiftOnSecurity My cats just throw up and then keep eating so I think they'd do OK.
        @SwiftOnSecurity this is about satiation. Regular eating patterns will satiate any mammal. If you provide hyperpalatable food all bets r off
        @SwiftOnSecurity Most cats, in my experience, tend to only eat what they need if their food supply is secure.
        *To be clear: Humanity can functionally produce unlimited calories, it's distribution incentives that are the cause of food inequality.
        This started out as casual pondering and ended up in economic systems. I need to be careful with this shit. Back to work.

        There isnt enough security talent to go around, and as an industry we spend a lot of cycles on things that don't matter. How do we fix this?
        Measuring an org's commitment to security by simplifying it to "breached/not breached" and "funded/not funded" is overly simplistic.

        'cyber-surveillance technology' includes 'digital forensics' http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/september/tradoc_154976.pdf ...  considered as "dual-use" items and subject of control?
        Scanning from passive DNS records including the "static" string gives much faster results than direct wide scanning. Maybe it's just me...
        @adulau I tell you, this EU self-made list of dual-use items is going to be worst than Wassenaar, bad effects to be seen in 1 or 2 years

        1st priority as a #blueteam should be awareness. If you can't detect initial access, lateral movement, escalations, or exfil. You've lost.
        A #blueteam's next priority should be segmentation, increase difficulty to traverse quietly, & limiting/identifying egress options.
        After your blueteam has got this down. Work with your redteam. *Always be redteaming* Your redteam shouldn't have schedules. Bad guys don't
        If, you're a defenderator and you;re not tracking this... you should  be.

        "We need a foreign policy based on peace, justice and human rights." 
        Why do people asking how many people marijuana has killed never ask how many prohibition has killed?http://bit.ly/2db0YGp 
        Unreal. WRT drugs, logic, baseline common sense, the ability or even inclination to weigh costs and benefits... all just eclipsed by hysteria.
        And these are the people who argue drugs degrade mental capacity. Can't make this shit up.
        This is prohibition. A potential 24 years in prison for selling weed. @IamCharloGreenehttp://bit.ly/2dEJlkQ

        .. niedrigen Zinsen sind, weil das Angebot an Kapital, welches Anlagen jagt, erhoeht wird.

        In a nod back to the financial crisis, Brad Sherman makes sure that Stumpf didn't fly in to DC on a private corporate jet.
        Brad Sherman makes a good point. How can Wells CEO say the fraud on cross-selling wasn't material when he bragged to investors about it?
        Congressman Luetkemeyer is saying the regulators should be fined and that money should go back to taxpayers. Weak.
        Banking "culture."pic.twitter.com/4VDT286Sq2
        Greg Meeks calls Wells Fargo a "criminal enterprise."
        Rep Meeks tells Stumpf his "criminal enterprise" has given whole banking industry a black eye.  They will all be called in to answer. #WFC
        It does seem like this Wells Fargo fiasco is a cultural turning point. America is turning away from the Greed is Good mentality.
        This anger at Wells Fargo and Stumpf is coming not just from the public but from the financial services industry itself.
        Fun timely fact: "The War of the Regulation" was an armed uprising against banking power in the 1760s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Regulation ... 
        Rep. Emanuel Cleaver turns Elizabeth Warren into a verb, says to Wells CEO: "You've already been Warren'd, I'm not going to Warren you."
        BREAKING: #IBM ($IBM) shakes up A.I. race for banking by buying Promontory Financial Group http://trib.al/lF9KdkT pic.twitter.com/qDHvsoOqtr

        This is significant.https://twitter.com/peteschroeder/status/781551637366136833 ...
