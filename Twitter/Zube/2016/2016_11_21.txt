        It's fascinating watching Stallman come to terms with data, rather than software, being the battleground.  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html ... 
        So far Stallman's remedy is "compile and write all your own software, and surf the web via email gateway" which I concede is very effective
        Traditional media has been terrible this election. They drowned us in trivia about both candidates, skipped issues.https://twitter.com/hbryant42/status/800040923174502409 ... 
        Everything is futile! RT @abhishiv: @Pinboard what about hardware backdoors? Isn't all this futile?
        I wish Stallman would address the fact that the safest piece of phone hardware to use right now is as non-libre as they come
        The heart of iOS security is a piece of software designed so you (or whoever gets their hands on your phone) can't possibly control it
        No, there isn't. Which kind of makes his advice useless.RT @TotallyBoard: @Pinboard there is absolutely no way rms has a cell phone
        Listening to Stallman on protecting data privacy is like taking diet advice from Gandhi. Proven effective, but not very helpful
        Stallman is sui generis and a valuable ally to have. It's just difficult to get pragmatic advice out of a purist

        Is this tweet for real, POTUS-elect? The statement was polite,respectful, and expressed both concern and hope. What is wrong about that?https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/800298286204723200 ... 
        The reason I loaded Twitter ;) was not to participate in politics, but to say: I wish there was a C++ library for data plotting - like ...
        .. matplotlib, but perhaps with a cleaner API, and a number of good plots to choose from.
        .. and even hopeful statement - I do not understand how being upset at that squares with "leadership". Sorry, but that is part of the job.

        S.Korean Pres. Park colluded with her secret confidant & presidential aides in major corruption, influence-peddling scandal: prosecutors
        Your expert is not saying what we paid him to sayhttps://twitter.com/yonhapnews/status/800253736811577344 ... 
        Today we close the Holy Door thanking God for having granted us this extraordinary time of grace.
        S.Korea's Park angrily rejects 'fantasy' accusations against her in corruption scandal, says they are built on 'imagination& guesswork'
        Park earlier promised to answer prosecutors' questions "sincerely" but apparently changed her mind, saying she will never meet with them.
        Current events in South Korea are concerning.
        Instead she will only 'deal with' new, independent team of investigators soon to take over current probe by prosecutors, her lawyer says.
        S. Korean Pres. Park is now criminal suspect in major corruption scandal involving her secret confidant @AFPhttp://u.afp.com/4JFq 
        The change of tack may buy Park some time legally but will fan anger over her. Now even 30+ members of her own party support her impeachment
        Meanwhile, recent opinion polls suggest growing support for Park impeachment, with latest survey showing 74% of S.Koreans backing the move

        @mattblaze They're acting as if it's the worst thing a politician has had to endure in a theatre
        Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Pence?
        You should totally forget about Trump's fraudulent fake "university" scam now that his VP has been mildly rebuked at the theatre.

        The Trump administration won't protect diversity and inclusion. Corporate America will: http://slate.me/2g69bLQ pic.twitter.com/2wqyoceMSa
        The reflex that some Dems have to see corporate America as inclusive and progressive was the point of this history.http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/ ... 
        Some Democrats have been seeing autocracy in the commercial realm as their friend for forty years. It's their instinct now.
        It's a direct line from the 1975 Banking Chair Committee fight killing Brandeisian ideas to a Slate article praising big business in 2016.
        The lens in this article of seeing progressivism as operating through big business has been going on for forty yearshttp://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2016/11/why_u_s_companies_are_now_the_most_prominent_progressive_force_in_america.html ... 
        Comments like 'well real billionaires support me', Warren Buffett as a validator, etc - that's all about rejecting democracy in commerce.
        The cultural touchstone of how elite Dems understand diversity right now - Hamilton - is a perfect metaphor for this shift.
        Reclaiming the mantle of the party of the people means seeing through the autocrats all around us. All of them.

        I rearranged my network and now Google services on my Android TV device keep thinking it's on the old IP address
        Android TV runs the Chromecast stack, which can only be configured from the Home app on your phone. Not on the actual device.
        Further, Android TV and Chromebox are two different Google platforms for plugging into TVs. Only one of them can run Hangouts.
        Android TV also helpfully tells me that the OS's request for rough location data was "Low battery use"
        It's frustrating because this is actually a fairly reasonable platform but there are *so* many rough edges and confusing behaviours

        Any solutions to 'fake news' that rely on validated sources will be defeated when president says X, media prints X with a little Y.
