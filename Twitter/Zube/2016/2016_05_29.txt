        It just occurred to me that this will be the fourth year in a row @nudehaberdasher and I will give a car hacking talk.  Time to move on yet?
        Our car hacking talk was rejected from defcon.  If you want to see it, you'll have to pay the big bucks at blackhat I guess.
        Thats my first rejection from defcon in 7 or 8 submissions.  I'm losing my touch :)

        Did you know? Comic books are actually for children! Next week: a related fact about Young Adult fiction that may surprise you
        This has badly burned me in the past. RT @ketralnis: hint: "adult fiction" and "young adult fiction" are totally different
        My bad: man-children. RT @bonsai: Not anymore. The target demographic has changed--not so for other comic-inspired other media offerings.
        Today, in my 41st year, I have occasion to perform an image search on "cougar scat". I'm hiking and want to know what I saw. Pray for me.
        I love the book "Bear Attacks, Their Causes and Avoidance", though I feel I have a pretty good handle on the causes (bears)
