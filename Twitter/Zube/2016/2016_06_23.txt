        $SCTY was going bankrupt this year, with a $700 million cash burn/qtr. $TSLA now assumes that cash outflow. Wow. This is a desperate move.
        One v smart tech invest or I now re $TSLA/$SCTY: "Is this even legal?"
        $TSLA buying $SCTY tells you all you need to know about Solar City and all you need to know about Tesla.
        So, $TSLA says it would be "the world's only vertically integrated energy company." It has never before called itself an "energy company."
        The red flags flying around this $TSLA / $SCTY are so many it's hard to count. Hey, Tesla holders, did you want to invest in an "energy co"?
        I'd say wrong analogy. Timing of this is horrific. More like Musk attempting to save Musk.
        Also worth noting: Musk has $475m loans secured by SCTY and TSLA stock.http://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-supports-his-business-empire-with-unusual-financial-moves-1461781962 ...

        Trump accuses Clinton of doing favors for foreign governments as secretary of state "in exchange for cash, pure and simple"
        Trump quoting Lincoln on the need for protectionism.
        Trump's case against Hillary appears to be "I know you are, but what am I?"
        Trump in this speech is reducing US-China relations to a tit-for-tat personal enrichment scheme benefitting the Clintons.

        Why is this using 8 bytes for MAC addresses?
        So https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX2ziMnm2tw&t=0m12s ...  is a real thing now?
        Ugh well the conclusion I've reached so far is that this plug is horribly overcomplicated and I need another drink
        All this obfuscation is entirely pointless because you can just replay packets fffffffffffffff
        https://gist.github.com/mjg59/ab1e9a6e60ef96ca9565ae09690a396b ...  well that was entirely underwhelming
        Oh good there's literally zero authentication on this one all you need to control it remotely is the MAC

        2016: Speaker of the US House ordered the live video feed cut off and @cspan is running live tweets/RTs of Democrat's sit-in from the floor.
        Now C-SPAN is showing a periscope of sit-in from the House floor - never seen anything like this.pic.twitter.com/KJ8ksYgFkQ
        Congress has a mandate - a constitutional mandate - to make the events that occur in-session available publicly.
        Now, the "Congressional Record" is the official vehicle, and CSPAN is not, so -technically- nothing untoward has happened yet.
        However, the behavior of the Speaker of the House to disallow CSPAN from recording is -very- peculiar.
        The whole purpose of Article I section 5 is so that the people of the US can have visibility into what its legislature has been doing.
        Cutting off a means of visibility is, bluntly, suspicious as all get-out.
        After all, "why are you hiding if you're not doing anything wrong"?
        Imagine Periscope gets a panicked call from a GOP Representative today. Do you want the company to have already built a big red killswitch?
        Next time folks argue for making it easier for copyright holders and governments to take down live streaming video, think of this moment
        C-SPAN has no control over the U.S. House TV cameras.
        There's a reason we want surveillance over congress available publicly:
        Surveillance is, after all, an expression of how much or little you trust a population.
        And I dunno about you, but I don't trust any individual representative farther than I can physically throw them.
        Much less the collective population.

        If we vote remain on Thursday I want to see Boris's face, in high definition close-up, as the result is announced.
        And then I'd like him to fuck off to the most inhospitable corner of the universe.

        FREE BREXIT POSTER FOR EVERY READER TO PUT IN THE WINDOW OF THEIR FUCKING SPITFIRES.
        Put your free Daily Express Brexit poster up in your conservatory and by conservatory I mean arse.
        Remember, a vote for #Brexit tomorrow is a vote for Boris as prime minister, a disaster akin to making a haystack King of Earth.
        This is the least apathetic the country's been in years, yet at the same time the most pathetic.
        "You owe three weeks," the newsagent says quietly. "TWO WEEKS!" Gove shrieks, his voice cracking. "I OWE TWO WEEKS YOU FUCKING NAZI!"
        I often think me and Nigel Farage would get on like a shit on fire.
        If you don't like it here Nigel why don't you fuck off back where you came from? Your house. Maybe go to the shop sometimes. Have a holiday.
        Nowhere foreign, obviously.
        Has the Leave camp actually used a fact yet? I genuinely can't remember them saying anything that's even wandered accidentally into truth.
        Every so often I get a hit of "I can't believe this is actually happening" about the referendum, like someone opened a trap door in my gut.
        The European Commission's Euromyths page, which could just as easily say "Fuck off Boris" in big letters: http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/ ... 
        Things Boris has promised we'll get back if we vote Leave: odours; padded cells; the birch; horses; press-ganging; urchins; knots; the Moon.
        The Democrat sit-in is laudable, but they look like hostages in a bank heist gone bad.

        The SHA3 hash/SHAKE thing can't possibly be coincidental, right? I mean, that's a winking reference, right?
        True as ever to form, HN can't get past the idea that there are good people who have been called "rock stars" whose feels might be hurt.
        Here is a news flash, HN: your heroes are probably not all that alarmed at the term "rock star" coming under fire. Most: embarrassed by it.
        Now, your instinct suggests, "sure, but at least nobody on HN says if only we'd listened to them there'd never've been a Duke LaCrosse case"

        Linux Australia, revisit the intent of having a CoC. If it only applies after criminal conviction, the message is: "the 1st 1+ is free".

        "The police should deal with abuse first" is the current trendy abuse deflection argument among nerds.
        Ironic, of course, from the Silverglate-worshipping "Three Felonies A Day" crowd. But there it is.
        Of course, the fact that there's all manner of abuse that doesn't warrant police intervention is why we have, I dunno, all of civil law.
        It's a self-evidently stupid deflection, you don't need my help shooting it down, just be aware that it's part of the zeitgeist right now.
