        That even a single-bit change in a massive dataset produces a completely different hash is called "Avalanche effect" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect ... 
        I've removed my tweet about MD5 being a good hash function, which I based on every-day use, rather than its weaknesses to targeted attacks.
        I apologize, I'll be more careful in the future about conflating casual application with strength. Thank you for the corrections.
        Can someone share an example of a malicious application that shares the same MD5 hash as a legitimate one? I did look a few years ago.
        @SwiftOnSecurity @chort0 I created 2 malware, same MD5: https://malwr.com/analysis/Y2M4Zjc4OWE0YmExNDA2MWE5YjFhODM5YjliNmI0MTY/ ...  https://malwr.com/analysis/YTc4Zjg0YTM0MTBhNDJiZDk4ZjFlODAwNjEzODM0YWQ/ ...  http://www.stopusingmd5now.com/

        Cylance is very keen that people recognize that "we do not do signature matching". https://blog.cylance.com/know-the-truth-signatures-and-multi-av-scanners ...  - but I would argue that ...
        .. a ML algorithm is nothing but a bunch of signatures (called "features") with weights calibrated by an optimization step.
        They may well be better than traditional AV (likely), but it is important to remember: ML is not magic pixie dust.

        Your horoscope today: if you bought a return ticket to work this morning, it was an unnecessary investment in your future.
        Or to give it its full title "Balls to former UK welfare minister Iain Duncan Smith's speech on the EU referendum"https://twitter.com/ReutersLive/status/729959600884166656 ... 

        The government's white paper on the BBC asks one pertinent question: why has no-one in the history of EastEnders ever had a shit?
        All it'd take is a minor script edit. "Answer me Phil, are you on the booze again?" "Hang on, I've just got to nip and have a crap." *drums*
        "Where's Dot?" "She's out the back shitting in a bin." "And she calls herself a christian."
        "So, what I propose is that we THROW the baby OUT with the bath water, because neither is economically viable."pic.twitter.com/LTE6Jc13YB
        I see Neil Hamilton is back on the sheep foetuses.
        It's possible Iain Duncan Smith is the most hard-faced, brass-necked, mendacious, psychopathic scumbag in the country.
        When Cameron does it it's not corruption, it's prudent fiscal planning.
        Daily Planet website: "This list of 14 people Superman DIDN'T save yesterday will shock you".
        "Eurovision?" Iain Duncan Smith bellows, pulling Y-fronts on over his trousers and donning a cape. "This is a job for Social Justice Iain!"

        If you look at crypto constructions through the lens of "new features", it makes some sense that it takes 4-6 years to standardize.
        But if you look at new crypto through lens of "these are patches to flaws in previous crypto", the lag imposed by standards is crazy.
        Ex: NIST P- vs. Curve25519. Debatable whether Curve25519 is _optimal_ replacement for NIST P-. But no credible debate P- is flawed!
        The track record for consumer goods named "America" isn't great.
