        US anti-encryption law is so 'braindead' it will outlaw file compression -http://bit.ly/1QcB0vF 
        there's a fundamental disconnect between hackers who've been doing vuln disclosure for years and those joining as part of the gig economy

        I don't think it's a good idea to pay candidates for interviews or work-sample coding challenges. I think it's a bad idea.
        Most importantly: it creates an incentive to pre-screen candidates w/ interviews, resumes before actually giving them a shot.
        Ironically, the candidates you most covet (w/ long resumes) could really give a shit about an interview stipend.
        But it's the candidates you SHOULD BE hiring that you're going to miss because you downselect before challenging them.
        Yup.https://twitter.com/coda/status/721133538196611074 ...
