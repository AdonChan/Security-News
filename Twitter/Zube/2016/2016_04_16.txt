        It's so crazy to me that the people in charge of keeping civil society safe actually think cryptography is their enemy.
        Never ever ever use `cp` to update in-use shared libraries. Doing so corrupts the file-backed mappings being used by the process.
        The TRIM command just tells an SSD's firmware to return zeros for a storage block. The physical chips still contain the deleted info.
        Although the SSD physical chips can contain deleted info, short of some firmware debug command, only desoldering the chips can retrieve it.
        Even if you desolder and dump the SSD chips, some SSDs always have encryption turned on. Also, the storage format is undocumented. Gibberish

        I find staying up-to-date on open source releases to be a difficult and time consuming process. Especially for @CronWeekly.
        I built a quick Twitter bot called @oss_announce that will share anything sent to an "announce" open source mailing list.
        A simple 30min hack built on top of https://marc.ttias.be  that should help me (and hopefully you) stay up-to-date on OSS.
        I've used Twitter as my main (technical) news source for years now, I think @oss_announce will make it even simpler.
        Now the only bottleneck is how many mailing lists I subscribe to. ;-)

        Loading a *very* large data breach into @haveibeenpwned. That's 10 medium Azure website instances and a P1 DB:pic.twitter.com/zXW0Lhko1M
        The website utilisation is so high as WebJobs take segments of the breach and insert it into Table Storage in mass parallelisation
        That'll all run for a few hours, cost me a few bucks then I'll scale back down to normal. Job done!

        So how were 55M Filipino voter records hacked? Simple SQL injection (allegedly):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTJjMTnEJdE ... 
        Not use PHP? :)
        New breach: In Feb, Mate1 had 27M accounts with deeply personal info exposed. 14% were already in @haveibeenpwned https://haveibeenpwned.com/ 
        That Mate1 breach has everything from drug use to sexual fetishes to income levels... and 27M passwords in plain text
        Needless to say, it's flagged as *sensitive* in @haveibeenpwned - it's *not* publicly searchable!
        About 6k emails are now going out to @haveibeenpwned subscribers re the Match1 breach, that may be a new record...
        What blows me away with Mate1 having plain text passwords, is nobody said "Hey, been a lot of breaches lately, we should check our things"
        A couple of months after the breach, they're still stored in plain text too
