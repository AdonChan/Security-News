        Story Time! - How did I break into your building?
        A lot of people will resent you for being good at what you do. Believe the exact opposite of what they say about you.
        In my day, people were not the cowards they are today, and would wait to tell you something to your face. This field has too many cowards.
        Lots of smart infosec people that nobody respects because they think they're the center of the universe. Just entertainment. What a legacy.
        Just saying...  women aren't the only ones sick of grown men who never grew out of the egocentrism stages of their childhood.
        Watch my critics, I've never done anything to anybody except not stroke their egoes. Look who's reacted for that, it says a lot about them.
        I'm old enough to remember when computing was about sharing knowledge and discoveries rather than developing a brand for yourself. Pity now.
        Most of my legacy in tech will be behind closed doors. The big, self-aggrandizing con talks are usually the first to be forgotten.
        Creepy guy seems obsessed with me. Still reading and angrily commenting on my (unrelated) tweets long after blocking him. Dude, move on.
        It's tough to get security appliances to audit, many vendors blacklist me (seriously). If you work for a vendor & want to help, let me know.
        @damienmiller which field would you say is more scientific, astrology or cyber attribution?

        The latest Le journal de ZATAZ! http://paper.li/eromang/1306086819?edition_id=05c2b7f0-669b-11e6-a40c-0cc47a0d164b ...  Thanks to @AnkaaEngine @MIRCA_France #feedly
        Cisco should be mad at NSA for holding vulns for years in it's products. EXTRABACON hurts Cisco's market position.
        #Snowden leaked NSA docs refer to ace02468bdf13579 for SECONDATE. Are all these tools not already public since #Snowden leak? #EquationGroup
        When "secret tools" have no more values due to an internal leak. Why no release them and pretend that it is also a leak? #EquationGroup
        Is the #NSAhack a real #NSAhack :) The leaked tools had no more a value in any case

        Assuming TAO dump really is Russia, I can't think of many other cases where an intel svc  publicly burned an adversary's  tech like this.
        I can think of lots of "look at the bug (or whatever) they had the nerve to plant" cases, but nothing where it's just a tech capability.
        But I'll bet @thegrugq can think of an example I'm missing.
