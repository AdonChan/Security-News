        This week I learned that AI true believers do not like their arguments presented in humorous form. Another giveaway that this is a religion
        AI obsession is not some weird religious cult, and when the Singularity comes, the Great Mind will smite you for having argued otherwise!
        what if the real roko's basilisk was the friends we made along the way
        I just hope Yudkowsky rebuts my incoherent, straw man, ad botinem arguments with a really devastating piece of Harry Potter fanfic
        I miss the simpler times when Yudkowsky was going to implement AI himself in a custom XML-based programming language http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/plan.html ... 
        @Pinboard to be fair, I've seen XML documents complicated enough that they may have had potential to become self-aware. I'm thinking SOAP.

        Ever wonder why you have to put Pokemon in PokeBalls to catch them and make them listen? Never thought about it, did you. I think I know why
        Pokemon are naturally collaborative and in some rare instances exceptionally amenable to humans, so we know they already have the wiring.
        Imagine if you could neurologically "push" Pokemon to go over the barrier and respect a human? How would you do it? Surgery? Medication?
        That's where the PokeBall comes in. During their digitalization of the Pokemon they alter its hormonal balance and imprint the owner on it.
        The populace has no idea this happens. The entire phenomena of Pokemon training and battles are a massive engineered societal conspiracy.
        It's all to sell PokeBalls.
        People always ask me if I'm drunk when I tweet this stuff. No. I'm just naturally like this all the time.
        "So this pokeball will turn matter into energy?"
        @SwiftOnSecurity According to Bulbapedia, a Pikachu weighs 6kg. That's ~5.4x10^17 joules, or the equivalent of 129 megatons

        What if Pokemon live in the 4th dimension. What if we're the ones in the Pokeballs.
        How many Pokemon died before they figured out how to make Pokeballs work
        *someone invents matter capture, compression, & restore technology*
