        Watched some schlocky show about John Lennon, Nixon and the FBI.
        When Nixon's landslide over George McGovern was mentioned, they ran a clip of George Wallace in a wheelchair. I love American history.
        When you enter into a FB conversation and then it suddenly turns bizarre and you're sorry that you're alive.
        When it comes to social media, I wish I was more like Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, pretending to not understand but understanding all too well.
        Testing to see who actually follows me: should I change my profile pic and oh so ironic headline? I'm feeling stale.

        Algorithms can help find truth through the statistical signals that often surround truth, but they cannot judge it directly. @brianstelter
        Of course, if your statistical design only sees truth learned from the the wording of the establishment, that's a major bias. @brianstelter
        Unfortunately, a broad understanding of this kind of nuance in how these systems function, and how they fail, is elusive. @brianstelter
        @SwiftOnSecurity this is tough because in part the secrecy of Goog's algorithm is what keeps every search result from leading to penis pills

        You should read these court statements by Trump's employees. http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-trump-women/#nt=oft12aH-1la1 ... pic.twitter.com/2jlx36ntHr

        "G Suite" is a stupid name.
        When people talk about how big a deal it was that YHOO didn't reset passwords my first thought is NOT how savvy these commentators are.
        I love watching tech nerds start from"the law is clearly stupid" & then slowly back pedal into something worse when shown exceptions.
        Pretty much everything @magoo says about startup security I feel like you can take to the bank. Plagiarize him shamelessly.https://twitter.com/boboTjones/status/781623742237671424 ...

        if you're surprised at the trib endorsement, go back and find the editorial in which they "bravely" admitted global warming is a problem

        Oh look, Trump is dominating the news cycle again. Whatever will we do.

        All this time I've been washing my dishes with non-supercharged powerballs like a CHUMP.
        Qubes OS has no exploitation mitigations at all and there have been multiple Xen PV breakouts in last year. So I agree, not bulletproof.https://twitter.com/snowden/status/781494387968794625 ...
