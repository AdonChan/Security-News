        Saw this old article for first time today https://www.yahoo.com/tech/maker-hacked-radio-says-system-unique-fiat-chrysler-191731497--finance.html ... 
        Two interesting things in that article.  1) harman talked about our research on their earnings call and 2) head unit code was 5 years old.

        OpenSSL is a great example of how awful open source software can be without adequate funding. "Free" and "open source" is a bad combination.
        If you're going to do open source, either procure funding to do it right, charge for it, or tell people not to rely on it.
        I love open source, I'm a strong open source advocate, but it's proven to fall flat on its face past decade due to lack of resources.
        Open source is never free. It always costs you something.

        Why the feds are wrong about warrant-proof phones. For most of history, the majority of comms were warrant-proof! https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601044/the-feds-are-wrong-to-warn-of-warrant-proof-phones/ ... 
        The irony in our philosophy on open source is that it includes a component of "you should have no problem if you have nothing to hide".
        We can't even figure out how to build half our open source projects. Talk to me again about how superior they are in terms of security.
        The reason open source developers have been unable to fix security flaws is because we've been arguing for ten years about tabs vs spaces.
        Look, I really respect @Snowden, but open source had its chance to prove itself 15 years ago and miserably failed to rise to the occasion.
        So if we're going to make open source work, we need a new strategy, not the same old love-freedom-love-knowledge-don't-shower approach.
        Multi-billion dollar corporations have milked open source to build their business on. You think maybe the GPL licensing model sucks?
        If the GPL had supported a model for commercial use rather than distribution, OSS would be funded by Facebook, Amazon, Apple. Billions.
        My personal feeling is that the GPL has done more to hurt open source in the long run by allowing authors to be bilked out of support.
        Been writing open source for some 25+ years by the way. I say this as someone who's seen all the ways it worked and all the ways it failed.
        If the next major license used in OSS allowed for royalties / support through use (not distribution), over time, money would flow in.
        The problem with OSS is we all started out in it led by an altruism and good nature that much of the commercial tech world doesn't share in.

        Davina's vagina is blinding my ret-ina. #SportRelief
        Hitler shot himself in the bunker; Iain Duncan Smith resigns. Hardly seems fair.
        Iain Duncan Smith: fuck off and keep fucking off until you think you've fucked off enough, then keep fucking off for another hundred years.
        It's a relief that Iain Duncan Smith has resigned but he is, to all intents and purposes, a mass murderer and should be prosecuted.
        My guess: Smith proposed the PIP cuts; Osborne agreed; it proved surprisingly unpopular; Osborne won't take the blame; Smith gets resigned.
        The only way tonight can get any better is if Iain Duncan Smith is sandblasted into a woodchipper and his remains used as a dog toilet.
        Jeremy Corbyn strokes his beard and watches Iain Duncan Smith resign. Time passes. Nothing happens.
        Last night, under the influence of alcohol, I stated that Iain Duncan Smith should be prosecuted for mass murder. This was incorrect. (1/2).
        I wholly retract that statement and would like to say instead, soberly, that Iain Duncan Smith should in fact be killed with a brick. (2/2)
        A few minutes ago I stated that Iain Duncan Smith should be killed with a brick. I misspoke. He should of course be set on fire first.
