        Wife heard a story about phone batteries catching fire.  She said I should research that.  Good idea ;) https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Miller/BH_US_11_Miller_Battery_Firmware_Public_WP.pdf ...

        FCA said in their statement that we used an old software version.  That was totally irrelevant.  Just to be safe, I jailbroke the latest.
        Their statement can be found in this article:https://www.wired.com/2016/08/jeep-hackers-return-high-speed-steering-acceleration-hacks/ ... 
        Anyway, came out of retirement for that.  Back to not hacking cars now.

        Distributed version control, especially, is absolutely wonderful. To the extent that I'm willing to tolerate the pain of TeX to have it.
