        At the funeral home across the street, a man was about to wheel a  body-bagged corpse into the home's side door when his phone pinged.
        He stopped, scrolled and laughed. I suppose life truly does go on.
        I wanted a pic of this, but when I raised my phone to take it, he looked  up and glared at me.
        Smiling, I put my phone away, so you'll just have  to imagine it.

        Asthma discovered to be triggered by Apple prices in all 50 states.
        ResearchKit/CareKit is sincerely some badass stuff. Huge props to Apple for using this platform to reach so many people. @tim_cook
        I know people working on federally funded health projects for years who haven't made the progress Apple made with ResearchKit.
        Apple so far:
        Apple is going the route of putting patient data into the hands of patient ownership, this is huge, something many have worked on for years.
        CareKit is open source so shutup.
        You don't lower prices on a good if you're selling them at your expectations at the existing price point. #AppleEvent
        Right after talking about the importance of HealthKit, Tim's now talking about how he orders takeout all the time.

        . @pschiller makes me feel so guilty for having a MacBook older than six months.
        Apple: Please buy the iPad, we can't possibly shove anything else into it. If this doesn't sell, I just can't even.
        iPad Pro: Just like a MacBook, only it comes in a lot of cumbersome pieces. pic.twitter.com/sJ8hZEw7wO
        The Apple Pencil was just used to erase a human. Just like that. He had kids.
        So now there's the iPad Pro for professionals, and the standard iPad for millennials.

        Framing crypto backdoor debate as "privacy vs. security" ignores the critical issue that backdoors would be a security disaster.

        Getting angry and violent at the slightest provocation isn't what I think of as "strong leadership", but I worry I'm in the minority here.

        They didn't ask me mine and gave me a silver "elite" key. America.
        Framing crypto backdoor debate as "privacy vs. security" ignores the critical issue that backdoors would be a security disaster.
        The FBI thinks (and wants) crypto debate to be about whether you can trust them. But even if FBI is completely trustworthy, the tech isn't.
        Crypto backdoor proponents' strangest argument: technologists are 'arrogant' when we say we don't know how to build reliable systems.
        This is why crypto back doors are a horrid idea: even ordinary crypto is *really* hard, and even the best can err. https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/711758196122198016 ...

        Periodic reminder that 90% of what matters isn't the vulnerability itself, but how the vendor responds to it.
        I assume Twitter's new animation for "like" is intended as an acknowledgment that with each "enhancement", they break our hearts.
        The hard part isn't creating a backdoor to an encrypted system. The hard part is doing it in a way that doesn't make the system insecure.

        Something's wrong when the W3C openly caters to DRM vendors. Also, Mozilla shouldn't have climbed aboard so easily.
        DRM is legalized ransomware.
        Wow. I just thought of something so horrible and so disgusting that it would be utterly terrifying to implement it.
        ...but it'd fit right in with modern "enterprise security solutions"
        Ransomware-based "Enterprise DRM" "PII safeguards".
        Basically, mod any of the popular ransomware packages to associate the encryption key with the local master server.
        Or, if we're doing this "as a service" with the provider's "cloud"
        Any access to the file has to request the key, so all modifications and reads are accounted for.
        And if you want to fire someone? Revoke their key access.
        Et voila! Nice, useful DRM/Ransomware for the enterprise, that'll lock down all that 'intellectual property' nicely.
        And if anyone ever implements this, I will hunt them down and [REDACTED]
        Before @_rshapiro + @_LightLaw's huge #FOIA win, @cia rejected reqs that had language "refer to."  Now use word "mention" + CIA cant reject.

        I am getting angry about the excuses tech teams make for incompetent hiring processes. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11329353 ... 
        Use work-samples, use unstructured interviews, use IQ tests, what the fuck ever. But no excuses: GET CANDIDATES FEEDBACK.
        Nobody's serious process is a secret. There are no good surprise interviews. TELL CANDIDATES WHAT TO EXPECT UP FRONT.
        Candidates hate when it takes forever to find out how they did. MAKE A SCHEDULE AND KEEP IT. You do with your customers, right? Right? ... ?
        Yes. More than a few tech company hiring processes are really disguised hazing rituals. https://twitter.com/ericnakagawa/status/711957402875068416 ... 
        College-age part-time retail workers at Nordstroms learn this level of customer service in their first weeks. NO EXCUSES.
        @tqbf gap btwn Microsoft (offer day after) and A Certain Company (offer 45 min before my MS deadline they'd known for weeks) was... something
        When people say your company's interviewing process is "grueling", THAT. IS. NOT. A. COMPLIMENT.
