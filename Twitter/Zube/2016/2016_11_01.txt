        reminder as peter thiel takes the stage to defend trump: he destroyed the site that first reported hillary's use of off-the-books email
        I'm excited about the Thiel speech today because it means @tqbf is going to owe me $1K on a 50¢ bet. My first 200,000% return! VC take note!
        A tipsy @tqbf bet me 2000:1 that @sama would have to break with Thiel after Trump said in the debate he might not accept an electoral loss
        "Just as much as it's about making America great, Trump's agenda is about making America a normal country,"-Peter Thiel, today, somehow
        To my great financial dismay, @tqbf was sober enough to cap the betting at $0.50, because I would have bet my entire savings otherwise
        Pretty sure this is an ad for hellpic.twitter.com/kKP4QvryPI
        Peter Thiel, verbatim: "If you're a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to our legal system."
        As a single-digit millionaire myself, Thiel's argument resonates with me, especially since my digit is 0
        Pretty savvy of Thiel not to put a number on how many women Trump would need to assault to lose his endorsement
        I realize my followers are sorely Thiel'ed out. It's been a long year. I'm going to shut up and go eat dinner with my lovely Croatian hosts

        The quintessential Clinton tactic: create scandals with reckless behavior, then claim surviving the self-made scandals proves grit/toughness

        Dem President Barack Obama's top appointee at the FBI is investigating Clinton...and Dems say it must be partisan. Think about that.
        Obama's hand picked FBI chief is apparently a villain for keeping the congressional committee that oversees the FBI informed about the FBI.

        Trump will get us to Inbox-zero in his first hundred days, assuming he handles his email the way he handles his finances.
