        I'm happy to announce the Community Covenant, a code of conduct for online communities including Slack and IRC. http://community-covenant.net/ 
        @imaguid @rodmacpherson HTTPS is authenticated encryption, not simply encryption. It's important even without a need for the encryption.
        It would be nice if ppl solved the right problems.
        I know it's more fun to build clandestine comms tools, but activists need tools that broadcast to a wide audience.
        Debunking bullshit is harder than establishing the truth, so an adversary can easily overwhelm activist's resources by simply bullshitting
        The information war you should be thinking about is how to make verifying truth vs bullshit easier.
        Only in America do we see the rise of white nationalism and agonize over whether or not we're being too rude to it.
        Unpopular opinion: an activist for a cause is better protected by having 500k (real) Twitter followers than by end 2 end encryption.
        OH: nobody wants to make tools to spec for a threat model that isn't the plot of a movie
        I wonder if driver state is such that you can run a real distro on the Pixel C rather than Android... anyone know?

        Lots of people are now paid to pressure journalists & say what they should do. There seem to be fewer people paid to actually be journalists
        There are lots of people employed by Clinton think tanks telling journalists how they should report on Clinton.

        Always fun to wake up to a series of increasingly insistent emails from a random person demanding immediate answer to a complex technical Q.
        Yes, random person, Sorry I was asleep when you sent me your first message, and an hour later, and an hour after that. I'll get right on it.
        9/11 flag-waving jingoism is offensive, but so is dismissing the deep personal pain inflicted on that day. Some of us still processing it.

        Sent answer to random guy who sent repeated overnight tech question. Thinking of having a cron job resend it every hour until he ACKs.
        9/11 seems to have permanently ratcheted up a skittish risk aversion that's permeated everything. "Better safe than sorry", always now.

        "You need to pay your taxes in a fair way. Part of that would be in the U.S., part in Europe. So get ready to do that." said Dijsselbloem.
        European tax authorities seem to be saying that Europe is no longer going to be a stop in the race to the bottom.
        it could be disingenuous. But it's not like Americans and Europeans are fighting over the same tax revenue.
        It's fascinating that virtually none of the dialogue around corporate power, taxes, or concentration makes it into the Presidential race.
        I don't think it's a money in politics thing, I think it's ideological. Corporate concentration is not seen as a political construct.
        Both party platforms and campaigns are chock full of interesting arguments about these questions. Virtually no coverage.
