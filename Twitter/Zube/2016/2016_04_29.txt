        Dealing with such incompetent management at @chevrolet makes me thankful for @tim_cook; Apple would not survive w/out him at the helm.
        There hasn't been one problem I've contacted Apple about that hasn't gotten first contact to address within 24 hours, resolved in days.
        Chevrolet, on the other hand, has been a root canal for over a year with zero help from @mtbarra to address their terrible management.
        I've had to retell my problems to over a dozen people and not one of them was technically competent to address software flaws @mtbarra.
        . @chevrolet is a $150 BN company and I fix more bugs than they do. Willful ignorant apathy. They'll go bankrupt again like this. @mtbarra
        If I was paid for educating everyone at @chevrolet I had to explain their own tech to, it would've bought me a new truck by now. @mtbarra
        I've had @chevrolet cruise control almost cause a few accidents, and bugs in their infotainment system turned a $52k truck into a $32k one.
        Pickup trucks are a crapshoot right now. The safe ones have crummy software. The ones that work well have bad crash test ratings.
        I've always loved the software and fit and finish on Dodge RAM unfortunately their airbags don't go off and crumple like paper in accidents.

        The -only- thing laws like this do is make you less safe, because it scares away benign security researchers.
        The 'bad guys' overseas are still going to be doing it all the time. This won't do a thing to deter them.
        Security by litigation doesn't work.
        Security by legislation doesn't, either.
        And hey, if you're going to get life in prison -anyway- if you crack a car, you may as well do summat worth the punishment, no?
        There are several depths of wrongness in this article.https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/726078804658130944 ... 
        First, obviously, that people don't know $2 are legitimate. Sure, ha ha, stupid Texans.
        Much more troubling: school children are being 'investigated' for adult-class forgery charges?
        That just ain't right. There's no call to bring the police into this at all. It's a school lunch for $2, not a $50k Cartier watch.
        ...which descends into the depths of why school administrators want to bring law enforcement in to (potential) disciplinary actions at all.
        Not much has changed since 1972.
        Dear game masters, you're welcome.
        IR: We're seeing COM+ bypass scripts coming in.
        You should probably use a password manager if you can, but assume that even your "good" passwords may be leaked some day & plan accordingly.

        Days...well, weeks, honestly, like this, make me want to go red-team.
        There's this idiot nonsense from the -20th Century- still infesting modern Windows OS. regsvr32.
        That for some -unholy- reason somehow has full network awareness, and shows up on the network like it's internet exploder.
        Which can fetch and execute arbitrary scripts!
        There's no clear IOCs from this shenanigans - I've been looking all week for something reliable and consistent, and found nowt.
        And when trying to figure out whether there's any potential, say, powershell logging, I find THAT is an even WORSE mess!
        Then this comes out: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/regsvr32-can-be-used-to-install-ransomware-through-jscript-installers/ ...  and I recall Outlook's lovely preview pane with JS parsing.
        Windows shops can, and probably will, get entirely pwned by a single email, with no good IOCs to diagnose afterwards.
        The only reliable countermeasures seem to be to block regsvr32 at the windows firewall, and block execution by non-admins...
        ...but that won't do squat for the millions of shops where everyone "needs" local admin for "reasons".
        What the -hell-, @msftsecurity - why do you people keep making my job even -more- impossible than it already is?!

        I wonder if the 'Office365' "cloud" has the same regsvr32 issue.
        Perhaps some catastrophic downtime for their flagship product these days might get some gorram attention to this festering rot.

        @rootkovska Sounds like the main product is a modified compiler, so the kernel's GPL shouldn't affect it.
        @rootkovska as the copyright holder on my code i get to choose the license ;). there're circumstances that steer that decision of course.
        @rootkovska so for the kernel it's GPLv2, the commercial version GPLv3 (to meet the eligible compilation condition needed for userland).
