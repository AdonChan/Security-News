        Since Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, saying "there are no jobs," the U.S. economy has gained more than 3.2 million jobs.
        Instead of investing in technology & creating a real economy, Putin opted to turn Russia into a gas station, instead of tech power.

        I do not believe that most of the people who are thinking about voting for Mr. Trump are racist or sexist.
        Some are, but I think most are people who are hurting, they're worried about their kids, they're working longer hours for lower wages.
        Our job is to reach out to Trump voters to tell them that we're going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just a few.
        Kind of a big deal. DOJ Antitrust issues guidelines to protect workers from collusion by employers to suppress wages https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/protecting-our-nations-workforce-through-antitrust ... 
        "Workers are entitled to the benefits of a competitive market for their employment." https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/protecting-our-nations-workforce-through-antitrust ... 
        "...harmful conduct that stifles competition and can lead to decreased wages, less attractive benefits, or even lost job opportunities."
        These DOJ guidelines are a subtweet of Apple/Google/etc for suppressing wages through an anti-poaching agreement.https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-google-offer-415-million-to-settle-poaching-lawsuit/ ... 
        And I know, three days before this election, that everyone is thinking about the use of antitrust on monopsony buying power against labor.

        Donald Trump suffers from a very serious disease called amnesia. He seems to have forgotten 8 years ago we were losing 800,000 jobs a month.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/794617042888491008 ... 

        If you sit this election out and Trump wins by a few votes, many people are going to be dealing with that reality for their entire lives.

        psa: bug bounties are not a cure-all. they *are* extremely useful for proving that you are more vulnerable than you thought you were.
        Sorry, but there's no "post Signal" messenger because developing software is expensive and time consuming. Someone has to foot the bill.
        Either the users pay for it, which is what SilentCircle tried (and why they now ignore consumers for enterprise/corporate customers w/money)
        Or there is outside funding, such as the >$2mm OWS has received from Open Tech Fund (plus whatever the license fees are from FB + GOOG)
        If you want a completely free, completely private, completely secure messenger you are out of luck. Sorry.

        The only way to stop a bad guy with a sign is a good guy with a sign.
        I should clarify, developers need to stop telling users to `curl | sh`, and either provide packages or copy/pastable instructions.
        It's pretty easy to imagine what #MAGA Twitter would do if Clinton fled a state and the threat turned out to be a dude with a sign.
