        ... and nominations for the 10th annual Pwnie Awards are now OPEN with six new categories for 2016!
        There needs to be some terminology differentiation between http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf ...  and http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35642749 ...  instead of just "car hacking"
        In one, you can send arbitrary CAN messages and affect safety of vehicle.  In one you can mimic the app and unlock doors and stuff.
        Techniques used are different, impact of attack is very different.Headlines still say "car hacked" and most people don't know the difference

        The #MUSATamperePlenaryMeeting ended yesterday. Below you can read about the main highlights of the meeting.
        So Blue Coat is becoming Green Coat but FireEye was left out in the cold. This is rather telling... 
        So everyone was up in arms because Blue Coat had an intermediate CA signed by Symantec's CA...  now what?

        My main reaction to most of these new phone features is to hope that there will be a simple way to disable them.
        Most of these features, for me, might as well be called "call a random person at a random time".
        There's a script for a disturbed person to get grandiose attention via mass murder. Claiming international terrorism acts as an amplifier.
        I suspect "I'm doing this for ISIS" is often as delusional as "I'm doing this because my neighbor's dog told me to".
        Our reaction is to uncritically accept one explanation when we'd immediately recognize the other as insanity. And a feedback loop is born.

        Thinking of setting up a lobby group called the National Earthquake Association, that will give money to politicians to support earthquakes.
        That way whenever there's an earthquake, politicians would have to say that if the victims had had earthquakes too, it would have been fine.
        Saying the solution to gun violence is more guns is like saying the solution to being allergic to nuts is being shot repeatedly with nuts.
        I'm going to continue posting analogies that don't quite work until the problem of gun violence is solved.
        I initially thought, why is it important to note that the victims were from the LGBT community? They were people first and foremost. (1/3)
        Then I realised, the gunman didn't kill these LGBT people because he had a problem with them being people. (2/3)
        He had a problem with them being LGBT. That was his primary motivation and why it's a crucial detail that shouldn't be shrugged off. (3/3)
        No, that's his normal voice.https://twitter.com/ReutersUK/status/742330937460064256 ...

        How notoriety motivates mass killers. Don't put their faces, names and manifestos on loop. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/opinion/the-virginia-shooter-wanted-fame-lets-not-give-it-to-him.html ... pic.twitter.com/pRVUfmQrow
        Research is clear by now: the intense, sensationalized attention on faces and words of individual mass shooters is inspiring future ones.
        US mass killers show no coherent ideological pattern to individual motivations. One thinks he's "Joker"; another thinks he's waging "Jihad".
        US-style mass shootings are a chronic problem; intense focus on individualizing each incident helps further the cycle by inspiring copycats.
