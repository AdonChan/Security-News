        What kind of click-through warning do you get in a DANE misconfiguration? None at all! Your whole site simply disappears from the Internet!
        .@dakami YES, I have a problem with universally available key-escrowed cryptography, like DNSSEC! YES! VERY YES! FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST.
        Opposing DNSSEC isn't opposing cryptography: it's opposing KEY ESCROW.https://twitter.com/dakami/status/771877552814108673 ... 

        I have several:https://twitter.com/thorsheim/status/771879790802501632 ... 

        1. It's a PKI whose roots are controlled by world governments. Nobody disputes this; advocates simply pretend it doesn't matter.
        2. It's bad crypto by design -- for instance, queries aren't encrypted -- because its design predates consumer crypto.
        3. It breaks the Internet, by moving a policy decision ("how to handle misconfigured site") into core protocol, making Comcast decide.
        4. It solves no meaningful problems at all. Literally none. DNSSEC has been "urgently needed" for 15+ years. Reality is: we don't need it.
        Until recently, an actual argument for DNSSEC: SMTP email could use it to get TLS key continuity, the way browsers already do.
        SMTP is no longer a live argument! Google and Microsoft and Yahoo are extending the protocol to do this w/o relying on DANE.
        @CiPHPerCoder @tqbf I don't concede that at all. It's a sloppy buggy chain that STILL GOES BACK TO DNS.
        This is a very popular pro-DNSSEC argument. I can refute it trivially: go get a domain-validated cert for Google.https://twitter.com/dakami/status/771883534193561600 ... 

        If you're very bored, and a total nerd, go through @dakami / me tweets today, find the spot where he rebuts that DNSSEC escrows keys to USG.
        There's a movie, one I'd really like to see, somewhere in the story of 1950s Kohler, Sheboygan, and the UAW.

        I think Dan is getting angry. I am trying not to make him angry, but, what can you do?https://twitter.com/dakami/status/771915838131572736 ... 

        Mathematical model: key escrow BAD.https://twitter.com/dakami/status/771917910713524224 ... 

        If DNSSEC root keys were on Pastebin right now, literally no site would need to do anything. Nothing relies on it.https://twitter.com/dakami/status/771918091211173893 ... 

        Reminder: you could publish the DNSSEC root RSA secret keys on Pastebin and nothing on the Internet that matters would break.
        And yet: DNSSEC is still full of RSA-1024 keys.
