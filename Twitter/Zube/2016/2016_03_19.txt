        Hey @Forbes : I'll turn off my TRACKING (not Ad) blocker when your site never serves malvertising again.
        The problem isn't ad blockers. The problem is that "ads" are more than just ads. They've become vectors for trackers and malware.
        Web ads have become a system where when you walk into a store, an army of salespeople secretly follow you home. Occasionally they rob you..
        If serving people malware is part of your business model, your business isn't publishing, it's crime.
        @KevinBanksto The Internet Security Implosion Act of 2016?
        One problem: unlike old media, web publishers don't effectively control the ads on their sites. So a site being "reputable" means nothing.
