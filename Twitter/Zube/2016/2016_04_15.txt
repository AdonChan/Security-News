        Finding evidence on an iPhone isn't an archaeological dig. It's more like an Easter egg hunt, and doesn't take more than a day or two.
        If you use the forensics tools most agencies use to play "find the penis", digging up evidence from an iPhone should only take a few hours.
        What we can extrapolate from FBI's SB investigation: If there haven't been any more AWA orders, no third party crypto was found.

        Made huge progress today on J-core SPI/MMC performance, but Linux is still about 1/3 to 1/2 the speed of bare-metal code reading SD card...
        ...and it seems to be just a matter of all the layers of crap the kernel puts you through for each 512-byte transfer block. :-(
        I still don't understand why block 2 of a multiblock transfer doesn't start immediately after block 1 finishes, but some 20k cycles later...

        Okay, minor rant: if you make GSM/2G/3G/LTE IoT devices, it's totally unacceptable to use the device IMEI as the only login credential.
        IoT is scary as it is w/o the prospect of someone taking an IMEI off your product and working backwards sequentially b/c you don't randomize
        I just found an IoT company site which will serve *location tracking data* if you put a valid IMEI for one of their products into a web form
        You can then use that IMEI to register an account with them if that hasn't been done already.
        Words have failed me.

        SHOT THROUGH THE HEART AND YOU'RE TO BLAME. YOU GAVE BADLOCK A BAD NAME. @SerNet
        Random rant:
        1) I'm not comfortable with the amount of callouts to MS that I feel comfortable introducing it into a customer network
        2) the amount of unfscking that needs to be done to make it usable for attack purposes seems very high
        3) It's just so much easier to use win 7 rather than deal with all the extra crap with win 10....
        Somebody tell me why I'm wrong...
        .@jepayneMSFT eliminating all the things that prevents me from doing 'bad stuff' on your network ;-)
        . @jepayneMSFT gaining a full understanding of whatever telemetry is being sent to MS and disabling as much as humanly possible
        .@jepayneMSFT as an attacker, I have attack tools... to you know, attack the network and stuff (with permission of course)
        This is america the answer is always yes.https://twitter.com/pfunk270/status/720327156123852801 ... 
        Dildos should be addressed to:
        . @jepayneMSFT Win 7 is much easier to delouse than win 10.
        . @jepayneMSFT it might be easier to go with a server os than than win10...
        .@kennwhite @jepayneMSFT I shouldn't need to introduce a hw firewall to use a VM on the network :/
        .@jepayneMSFT indeed.  like I said, making it easier on me is the reason I have an attack platform
        .@JakobHeidelberg @jepayneMSFT All MS needs to do is provide a list and why I should allow it ;-)
        @donttrythis are you concerned future WH science fairs could possibly limit participation to children that can be build really good walls?
        .@JakobHeidelberg @jepayneMSFT I'd settle for a rules manager not designed to be mass admin'd by GPO

thepacketrat

        So far, a baker's dozen of robocalls today for "Home Security", "solar panel free installation", and one OVR that I just hung up on.
        Thanks, @FTC. It looks like all the numbers I registered for Do Not Call are not actually registered. That explains yesterday's 17 robocalls
        Then again, nobody pays attention to the Do Not Call list anyway.
        Not worth a story, but a couple of tweets: 1) Maryland MVA offices had a network outage that shut down drivers license system access...
        2) Because they broke a firewall last night during maintenance and shut out everyone. Had to bring offices back on 1 by 1. <facepalm>
        What's shocking about Maryland MVA outage is that they actually *have* internal firewalls.

        BREAKING: @MatthewKeysLive has been sentenced to two years in prison.
        Apple did not "defy" a court order. They exercised the right of *everyone served with a subpoena* to challenge its legal adequacy & burden.
        Somewhat amazed that "Longest Serving Republican Speaker Of The House In History Turns Out To Be A Child Molester" isn't a bigger story.
        This article in Slate about the Matthew Keys hacking case is total bullshit.http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/04/13/matthew_keys_will_serve_two_years_for_something_that_was_barely_a_crime.html ... 
        Keys didn't share his Netflix password with a friend. He gave a login to a Trib Corp CMS to a hacker group and BEGGED them to "demolish" it.
        Nothing serious happened because Keys is an incompetent nitwit. He cannot now hide behind the label "journalist" to shield himself.
        But even though nothing serious happened, he surely incurred tens of thousands of dollars in breach investigation/cleanup.
        Ballpark cost of a post-breach assessment, to meet insurance company reqs, by a real DFIR firm? $40-60,000.
        Slate should be embarrassed for being so easily bamboozled by this moron.
        Absent from Slate's story: the period BEFORE this breach, where dismissed Keys repeatedly locked his successor out of CMS to harass.
        Also missing: Keys stole database of email address from Trib Corp viewers and spammed them with harassing mails.
        Hed on @justintrevett's story: "A journalist was just sentenced to 2 Years In Prison For Something Most Of Us Do". What? None of us do that!
        Is 2 years a bananas sentence? Probably, yes. ALL sentences in the US are. But Keys is FAR more culpable than Auernheimer was.
        Is this Vice reporter lying about the emails? http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-the-government-went-after-matthew-keys ... https://twitter.com/MatthewKeysLive/status/720676507891335168 ...
