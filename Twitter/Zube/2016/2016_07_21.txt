        When did it become "dumpster fire" instead of "tire fire"? Tire fire seems better metaphor; dirtier, less contained, harder to extinguish.

        So it'll be President Biff, I guess.
        A soap opera star turned avocado farmer has opinions. You will hear them now.
        I am very curious to see if voters think this convention is the disaster journalists seem to think it is
        This woman actually is pretty good. A quality speaker.
        There is actually policy in this speech. Whoa.
        She's talking about trade, unions, and working people, and the actual industry of making movies and farming.
        Someone is finally talking about policy. She is apparently a soap opera actress who grows avocados. #RNCinCLE

        The problem with relying on polling for issues is that voters often change their views based on what leaders argue.
        Voters have opinions, but they want to hear what pols think b/c pols tend to know more. Like you ask for friend who loves cars about cars.
        Not that this friend determines what you think, it just informs you.
        So if leaders shape their views based on polls of voters and voters shape their views around opinions of leaders then there's no real debate

        Theme for Day 2 of #RNCinCLE : Make America White Again.
        Instead of RNC, binging on Netflix's Marco Polo. Kublai Khan and Donald Trump agree on a lot of policy, except walls and immigration
        @thepacketrat Pretty sure they'd disagree on crypto policy.
        @thepacketrat Kublai staged two failed invasions of Japan and I would still give him the edge on foreign policy.
        Clearly Trump got his "kill the terrorists' families" idea from Kublai Khan.
        I get the sneaking suspicion this Netflix "Marco Polo" is not strictly historically accurate
        Waiting for Kublai Khan's election campaign slogan for the khanate : Make Mongolia Great Again.
        Why do I get the feeling that in six months or so most of the world will regret that the Turkish coup failed?
