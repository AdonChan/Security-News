        Deja vu is basically a hash collision in your brain.
        Anyone have ideas why Chromecast somtimes lies that it's connected to wifi but not to the internet?
        This is after dhcp success. tcpdump shows absolutely zero traffic from the ip address the Chromecast was assigned.
        So somehow Chromecast has decided it has no internet connectivity without trying to send any ip packets...
        This happens for a long time after boot with AP using hostapd on Linux, not with cheap netgear router.
        dhcp server is identical either way (netgear config is pure bridge).
        Are they doing something idiotic with the AP's MAC address and assuming certain MACs are clients not routers?

        For breaking news, I especially appreciate the "what we do and don't know" stories.
        Worst. Product. Placement. Ever.https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/778016283342307328 ... 
        For the record it's Prof. @SteveBellovin. He is AWESOME. Also very approachable despite being super busy. We need more people like this. https://twitter.com/pvineetha/status/778041927451246592 ... 
        Though, in fairness, if the point is that you shouldn't eat refugees, I agree.
        If you told me that three @skittles in each bowl are poisonous, I'd look at the data and conclude that you're wrong about Skittle safety.
        The Skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. Changed from M&Ms to Skittles because of George Zimmerman.https://twitter.com/rschooley/status/778033000474750976 ... 
        A rep for @Skittles gives me their response to @DonaldJTrumpJrpic.twitter.com/OmkJQkIqug
        I'm extremely familiar with the area where Rahami and family lived. It's amazingly diverse--zoom in on Google Maps or Streetview (1/3)
        Kosher restaurants and butchers, Hispanic places, generic American ones--and a fried chicken place run by Afghan immigrants (2/3)
        This is what we need more of, not mindless bigotry against this group or that one. Say "no" to xenophobia (3/3)
        Quick reminders before you direct your yelling.
        Also, editorial writers often do not seem to read their own newspapers.
        You can't make this stuff up.https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/778295172559806464 ... 
        I remember these incidents; frequently watched the bomb truck race up 1st Ave from my childhood bedroom window. We're resilient.https://twitter.com/jimdwyernyt/status/778300695426568192 ... 
        One of the big difference between then and now is how quickly the bombers generally get caught today. Very different game. @jimdwyernyt
        @mattblaze very true. Also, they're louder now, reverberating in the social media echo chamber
        First they take away our headphone jacks, then they poison our Skittles.

        Watching Elizabeth Warren grill Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is a delight.
        As a former student of @SenWarren I don't envy Wells CEO John Stumpf. As a citizen I'm absolutely thrilled to watch her tear into him.
        One might call that a motivehttps://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/778255780973780992 ... 
        Elizabeth Warren is just wow.
        Sen Warren to Stumpf. You should resign. You should be criminally investigated.  http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=B80F9B81-4331-4F95-91BC-718288EC9DA0 ... 
        A really significant difference with Elizabeth Warren is that when it's warranted she doesn't assume good faith on the part of an elite.
        WARREN SAYS STUMPF SHOULD RESIGN, FACE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
        Donnelly just said in a Senate hearing that "it all flows downhill". Closest you're going to get to actually cursing.
        Sen. Warren blasts $WFC CEO: "You should resign...and you should be criminally investigated..."pic.twitter.com/uSB5UB6H6s
        Elizabeth Warren isn't just channeling the anger of normal Americans, but also small bankers pissed that Wells is disgracing their industry.
        CEO Wells Fargo: "We spend so much time trying to do the right thing." 
        Warren says Stumpf personally made $200 million from "this scam."http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2016/09/20/live-blog-and-video-as-wells-fargo-ceo-stumpf-testifies-to-senate/#entry_33 ... 
        So people trolling Elizabeth Warren today do realize they are taking the side of the Wells Fargo CEO cheating workers and customers, right?
        Glad the SEC is trying to lower the materiality standard right now.https://twitter.com/IanMcKendry13/status/778266285792788481 ... 
        Sherrod Brown is now pointing out that mandatory arbitration clauses prevented customers from using courts to stop Wells Fargo scams.
        Senator Bob Menendez asking Wells CEO how many people were fired for refusing to commit fraud to meet sales targets. Powerful point.
        Wells CEO treating the board's compensation committee like it's a sacred court of law is ridiculous.
        @matthewstoller I think this is a setup. Warren is baiting him.
