        Dithering http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithering 
        A natural cubic spline is the smoothest function interpolating a set of points. http://bit.ly/4xO8U 
        In the context of DSP, A/D stands for analog-to-digital and D/A stands for digital-to-analog.
        Loudness and sharpness http://ow.ly/1uFd3006oze 
        The Fourier transform of a sequence converges absolutely if and only if the z-transform converges in a region containing the unit disk.
        A FFT is a linear transform, so it can be represented by matrix multiplication.
        Matrix-vector multiplication general takes O(N^2) operations, but FFT takes O(N log N) operations.
        The SciPy Python library has a large collection of signal processing functions under scipy.signal. http://scipy.org/ 
        The unit step sequence u[n] is 0 for negative n and 1 otherwise. The z-transform of u[n] is z/(z-1).
        Evaluating sinc sums http://ow.ly/W1sHY 
        The z-transform of the discrete time impulse Î´[n] is 1.
        Let x[n] be a sequence and X(z) its z-transform. Then the z-transform of x[n - d] is X(z) / z^d.
        If the z-transform of x[n] is X(z), the z-transform of n x[n] is -z X'(z).
        If the z-transform of x[n] is X(z), the z-transform of x[-n] is X(1/z).
        Psychoacoustic roughness http://ow.ly/105i0F 
        The z-transform of a convolution of two sequences is the product of their z-transforms.
        Measuring strength of evidence in decibels http://bit.ly/58GNM0 
        A system is LTI (linear time-invariant) if it is linear and shifting the input shifts the output by the same amount.
        Finite differences have properties analogous to derivatives. http://bit.ly/datE4r 
        FIR = finite impulse response. The response to a finite sequence is finite.

        Along with a group of New Dealers, Patman opposed media consolidation. Against chain banking, chain stores, and chain newspapers...
        Most remarkable New Dealer on media consolidation was Clifford Durr. RFC, then FCC commissioner, then resigned to fight Joe McCarthy.
        Durr started out as a racist Alabama corporate lawyer in the early 1930s, ended up as the lawyer for Rosa Parks in the bus boycott.
        Durr was definitely a traitor to his class. Was ostracized locally until the 1970s, when he was finally recognized for his work.
        His wife, Virginia Foster Durr, was even more of a badass.

        Mike Pence's plane was saved from crashing into Grand Central Parkway by FAA-mandated EMAS installations. Saved by big government.
        Another way of looking at this: Mike Pence's plane just caused significant damage to taxpayer property.
        Ironically, Pence was flying on a plane owned by "Eastern Air Lines", named after the defunct airline from the 1930s that went bust in 1989
        Eastern pioneered "shuttle"-style service along the eastern seaboard, but sold that business to Donald Trump to form the Trump Shuttle
        (Trump Shuttle basically went bust in 1992)
        The original Eastern went bust after vicious asset stripping by Frank Lorenzo, who declared bankruptcy so he could hire non-union staff
        Courts determined that Lorenzo was not fit to run the airline and forced him out, but by then there wasn't enough airline left to make money
        25 years later and their brand was reanimated by a charter airline who won the Trump/Pence contract and then proceeded to fuck up at LGA
        Basically the entire story is one of capitalism fucking up everything else (and being further fucked up by more capitalism)
        ... which makes it a perfect metaphor for the Trump/Pence campaign
        This...  really makes me reconsider how much I should trust @thewirecutterhttp://thewirecutter.com/blog/are-smart-homes-open-houses-for-hackers/ ... 
        Yeah, sure, you're unlikely to be the target of a random hacker. How about if your abusive ex is an IT expert?
        I'M GLAD THAT YOU ARE ASKING THE VENDORS WHETHER THEIR DEVICES ARE INSECURE THEY WILL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU A USEFUL AND ACCURATE ANSWERpic.twitter.com/a3Efrj62d2
        The IoT risk for the internet is based on trivial insecurities and botnets. The IoT risk for individuals is how competent your stalker is.
        "This camera is fine as long as you never meet a creepy security dude in a bar" well cool
        â€@thewirecutter Pretending that (not very!) skilled adversaries are irrelevant when choosing an IoT device is just irresponsible
        Anyway, my advice right now: If you are not an IT expert, don't buy any IoT stuff that isn't a Philips Hue.
        HALLOWEEN REMINDER: if you use your Trump costume as an excuse to grope people, you're committing *sexual assault*. Also, you're an asshole.
        I wrote a longer piece on why I think @thewirecutter's IoT security advice is garbage: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/45483.html 
        (Summary: not everyone has the same risk profile as a middle class man, look at what vendors do, not what they say, everything is on fire)

        GEORGE HOTZ: I made a self-driving car
        You can't simultaneously believe that vendors should be liable for security flaws & that startups should make unregulated self-driving cars.
        Congratulations to the DNSSEC community for using stronger parameters with an algorithm so bad that it is being removed from TLS 
        To top it all off, Ian also found a bug in auto-generated MIG code leading to a UAF on a mach_port_t: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=882 ... 
        When Ian first started doing public research, we had queries about whether "Ian Beer" was pseudonymous cover for a group of researchers.
        It's 2016, and DNSSEC is JUST NOW deploying 2048 bit RSA.
        Problem with self-driving car startups same as that of money transfer startups: company will never have adequate assets to satisfy liability
        Sure, you can be liable for deaths caused by your self-driving car. So what? You go out of business, start next company.
