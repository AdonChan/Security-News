        I thought of a way that I could make an "x32" target work on Windows, but I don't think it'd be useful. (x32 is x86-64 with 32-bit address)
        My idea for implementing x32 in Windows is to tell Windows we're 32-bit, but switch modes with far jumps.
        My x32 Windows design would support most DLLs by using 32-bit versions. 32-bit Windows DLLs, using thunks for crossing modes.

        "By (..) 2018, technology will make available to (..) the major nations (..) techniques for conducting secret warfare." -- Brezinski 1982
        Somebody I hold a very low intellectual opinion of managed to undershoot that opinion by a mile. I am impressed. Deeply impressed.
        "The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by ... (1/4)
        ... an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over ... (2/4)
        .. every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. (3/4)
        These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities." -- Brezinski, 1970 (4/4)
        Turns out that this isn't a verbatim quote, but an amalgamation of two quotes. https://www.tragedyandhope.com/researching-the-infamous-quotations-attributed-to-zbigniew-brzezinski/ ...  (5/4)

        What is the recommended way to install new Fonts on iPads? (Beside AnyFont app)
        The smart keyboard is still alien to me.
        When I write on the smart keyboard it happens all the time that my finger touches undo on screen which then destroys whatever I just wrote.
        So Keynote for iOS cannot even edit master slides. So much for using an iPad Pro for work related things...
        So every time I have to edit the master slides in keynote I have to export to a Mac, edit and then reimport. The Apple way...
        So what is the unofficial rules about private APIs and the AppStore? Considering there are apps in it that 100% rely on private APIs.
