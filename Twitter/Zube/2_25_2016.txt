        Oh, all the beautiful chat history that comes off of Skype in a simple backup. A smorgasbord for law enforcement. pic.twitter.com/kprOh5seU3
        This is everything that comes off an iPhone from the Signal app with backup or forensics tools. Virtually nothing. pic.twitter.com/tyPStYlQbQ
        Signal is the only third party messaging app I would actually endorse. See the EFF's retro style scorecard for why https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard ... 
        Signal's not perfect, but the FBI would have to force Apple to develop even more tools to have a chance. A strong passcode is everything.
        If you're going to use Signal, I recommend setting up with a virtual phone number e.g. from TextNow, etc.
        All of Skype's chat history is stored in the Documents folder and in clear text, so it's copied over in your backups. Isn't that great?

        Using a wireless keyboard is a bad idea even without this. Timing leaks a lot of info, even if encrypted.
        What would the FBI do if the most popular smart phone had an OS people could build and sign themselves?
        Terrorists with locked iPhones shoot people, and we talk about weakening or outlawing encryption instead of guns.

mattblaze

        @mattblaze there's a great paper on this: 
        FBI/DoJ has effectively portrayed a minor aspect of an investigation of a months old crime as an urgent crisis. Crises create bad policies.
        Tech forensics ed/personnel urgently needed for the FBI based on this request. See, e.g., http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57967   https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/702221928568741888 ... 

        They're also attempting to characterize concerns about creating vulnerability in our infrastructure as special interest "privacy advocacy".
        You know what I look forward to at the end of a long day? Firing up the game console to relax and being told I need a 1GB update first.
        I'm worried they're going to use the All Writs act to make me take out some super mutants.
        More detail about the CMU/FBI Tor attack. (H/T @josephmenn).  I remain amazed at the CMU IRB, if they approved. http://motherboard.vice.com/read/carnegie-mellon-university-attacked-tor-was-subpoenaed-by-feds ... 
        By retaining data, CMU failed to exercise the basic responsibility of any human-subject researcher: protect your subjects.
        I'm 95% convinced that they periodically have my phone do a "carrier setting update" alert just to mess with me.

        These lights are *great*
        Well shit I think I've figured out the entire interesting part of this protocol and now I'm just left with these crummy GPL-violating bulbs
        If I send it 0C, the management process dies
        Ok I can discover the bridge, get it to discover bulbs, control individual bulbs and control all bulbs. Suspect I'm done.
        Although I've a reasonably strong suspicion that there's no meaningful protection against anyone else controlling your lamps
        ... yeah these are definitely some hardcoded cloud credentials
        Ok yeah the credentials are hardcoded and I can control anybody's lights as long as I know the serial number of their bridge \o/
        In summary: 1) GPL violating 2) no local network security 3) no remote network security 4) commands that crash 5) not actually good bulbs
        Summary of the summary do not buy http://www.amazon.com/iSuper-iRainbow001-Lighting-Automation-Android/dp/B00GTCF436/ref=cm_cr_pr_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8 ... 
        I mean sure I'll write a python module to control them and integrate it into ulfire but come on
        They're going back to Amazon after that, I can tell you
        Two IoT devices I have ever bought without being able to hack within days. Two.
        Oh cool the command that dumps binary crap is the "Rename the bulb" command that's reassuring
        I'M SURE THE STRING PARSING THERE IS TOP QUALITY
        I'M SURE THAT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SEND THIS COMMAND TO THE BRIDGE OVER THE INTERNET IS NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN WHATSOEVER
        The bridge for these lights is (a) running an AP (b) will let anybody associate (c) is running telnetd with default creds on it
        No of course none of this is documented
        The bridge won't let you control it unless you press the button on top first and then connect within the next minute.
        But it'll tell you its serial number anyway. And the serial number is all you need to control it via the cloud server.
        ... thus making the entire thing pointless

        There is no reason your on-site tech job interviews need to produce "HIRE" / "NO HIRE" outputs from interviewers. In fact: harmful.
        Better: produce structured, factual outputs that your process can interpret to generate HIRE/NO HIRE.
        You can iterate on what facts are most predictive, get better over time. You CAN'T iterate on "HIRE/NO HIRE" from interviewers.
        Almost every programmer interview process in the world involves random selection of interviewers VOTING "HIRE/NO HIRE". Noxious.
        Joel Spolsky had an article strongly recommending that every interviewer get a VETO "NO HIRE" vote. Made sense when I read it. Now: INSANE.
