+         Today Donald Trump sent out tweets from an iPhone.
+         Only Silicon Valley minds could have come up with the idea of an apoliti
+ cal Trump policy tracker. What's the plan for when it's all green?
+         Obvious problems with "Trump tracker" sites:
+         No good can come of them. Double digit % of Trump supporters, shown side
+ -by-side inaug. Photos, said Trump's better attended.
+         Probability that some cartoonish tech company tracker will inform resist
+ ance or persuade supporters is nil.
+         Framing problematic. Tracking "fulfillment of promises", in almost any o
+ ther context a good thing.
+         Made all the worse because the list conflates banal motherhood/apple pie
+  promises with "ban Muslims".
+         Organize your workplace. Get friends to run for office. Pressure your lo
+ cal reps to deny confirmation.
+         Want to build a pretty app to help the resistance? Make it help with tho
+ se three things. There are elections THIS YEAR.
+         Reminder to techs: work is political whether you like it or not. Apoliti
