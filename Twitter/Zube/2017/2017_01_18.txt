        The current conversation around attacker vs defender seems to do nothing more than create a bigger gap between the two. Not really helpful.
        We should be looking at ways to bring the two sides closer together, not moan about the fact that the other side is "doing it wrong".
        "You've never had to do X" is valid, but not constructive & is focused on a retort target than how better to resolve or action an issue.
        I get that certain findings have very poor recommendations. We can do better. Let's work on taking about why, rather than mud slinging.

        Later, I plan to do a deep dive on @Saif_Sherei's bug, effectively live streaming his efforts in a lame attempt to understand what he did :)

        Let's go through his broken promises, shall we?
        "We will strengthen the ability of workers to organize unions and fight to pass the Employee Free Choice Act."
        "We will fight to ban the permanent replacement of striking workers, so workers can stand up for themselves... losing their livelihoods."
        "We will also ensure that every American worker is able earn up to seven paid sick days to care for themselves or an ill family member."
        "To help workers share in our country's productivity we'll expand the Earned Income Tax Credit & raise the min wage & index it to inflation.
        "We will encourage diversity in the ownership of broadcast media."
        "We will work to reform bankruptcy laws to restore balance between lender and homeowner rights."
        "We will work with Canada/Mexico to amend the North American Free Trade Agreement so it works better for all 3 North American countries."
        There are more. A lot more - remember the whole 'seas will start to recede thing'. These were all straightforward promises.
        The reason you didn't hear about these broken promises - the agenda he didn't pursue - is because of people like Jonathan Chait.
        @matthewstoller That's part of it, but I think the reason some don't hear about it is because they don't want to. Criticism of Obama is met/
        @matthewstoller /with lots of resistance, or a comparison to Trump, or immediate excuses at the ready. People don't want to know.
        Literally the only piece I ever saw in the last eight years on what Obama promised was one I wrote in 2012.http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/09/broken-democratic-platform-promises-from-2008.html ... 
        And yet the absurd claims - oh people believed what they wanted about Obama not what he promised - continued. Fact free.
        Democrats for the last eight years didn't want to know. And people like Chait didn't have the courage to be honest about what was going on.
        But normal voters did notice that the claims didn't come true. We can't afford to wallow in self-delusion anymore. We must free ourselves.

        May's plan to make it easier for foreigners to buy property in London and drive up prices for residents seems to be working out well so far

        Today I spent some time in a ski/outdoor store trying to buy smth.. Concluded I wouldn't mind if clerks were replaced by robots, after all.
        Maybe robots would segfault if I asked some non-standard questions, but at least would not take a personal offense, methinks.
        Another random question: any idea what was the first computer virus that infected other executable files (i.e. a parasitic virus)?
        Even if @el33th4xor can get a SGX license, Teechan can be shutdown by Intel at any time, e.g. due to legal requests. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/e1/e6/sgx-sdk-commercial-use-license-agreement.pdf ... pic.twitter.com/Lw2FMcnAwD
        More than shutdown: Intel can impersonate any SGX-based Service Provider by simply faking Remote Attestation responses.https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/821280671888973825 ... 
        I think there is a way to both liberate SGX and remove Intel from position to fake RA responses, but nontrivial, requires months of R&D.
        (I might also be wrong, which I cannot know before investing all the effort to implement a PoC, beware.)

        In the context of encrypted messaging systems like WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage, key substitution attacks are a huge vulnerability.
