        I've been trying for a while now to get better security for secure messengers. It's kinda frustrating. Nothing does offers complete package
        Unfortunately no one has wanted to actually pay for expert advice on improving messenger security, at least not from me. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
        Fuck it. Use WhatsApp, it lacks critical features but has good e2e. use Signal, it is clunky but doesn't log metadata.
        Use Threema, it is anonymous and works without Google Play Services (but the protocol sucks.)
        Use Conversations, it requires loads of configuration and your counterparty might not support OMEMO. But it works without google play.
        Use ChatSecure on iOS, it has OMEMO, requires configuration, can't keep long running background sessions open
        Almost none of these have good end point security (Signal, Threema are the exception.) end to end is table stakes,not the end game
        @UMAD no idea? Signal is promoted as anti authoritarian, WhatsApp is used by school groups.
        Dear infosec vendors, what's with the trend with oversimplifying your websites to the point you have sparse info and often no screenshots?

        On a rhetorical level, Democrats mock and misuse "Make America Great Again", but they RESPOND to it. It traps them.
        The only sticky rhetoric from opposition groups in the last few years is Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. Not from Democrats.
        No, just that there's a lack of vision among Dems. That's why they have no rhetoric. Good messaging starts w/vision.https://twitter.com/blakerosser1/status/822501629446541312 ... 
        Best proposed rhetoric for Dems is "break the power" and it's focused on a vision around breaking monopoly power.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/januaryfebruary-2017/democrats-must-become-the-party-of-freedom/ ... 
        The key moral pushback against where we at is to recognize that people are not just motivated by money and power.
        America was born out of the belief that citizens are public servants, and that we can self-govern. It was a rejection of Hobbes.
        It is important to recognize that leaders and intellectuals can choose to govern to promote liberty, or not. We must differentiate.
        Accepting, as many on the left and right do, that man is selfish and a rational self-maximizer, is a rejection of America.
        It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If man is inherently selfish, corruption is not a coherent concept. Or, he took a bribe, whaddya expect?
        John Kenneth Galbraith, a staunch socialist, accepted this cynical view of mankind. So did George Stigler, a creator of law and economics.
        Rejecting politics as inherently corrupting, per se, and choosing 'activism', means that your reject the idea of corruption as a problem.
        I mean, if it's inherently corrupt to be a public servant, then who cares if someone does a good job or takes a bribe. Whaddya expect?
        You cannot admire parts of American history, or be angry at politicians, or business leaders, and still accept Hobbes. Whaddya expect?
        Democracy, alive among the protesters, in the anger from Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, in the Bernie speeches, is admirable.
        Democracy is scary. It means accepting our own wisdom, fallibility and responsibility as moral actors, and confronting our delusions.

        ... increasing military funding, demonising immigration.

        I was surprised by unbelievable amounts of bullshit which was presented to public in recent Intel DCI research by @ptsecurity [1/x]
        2) It requires DCI interface physically routed to USB debug port, quite rare thing for mass market devices [3/x]
        3) It requires USB debug port accessible outside, many laptops (ThinkPad series for example) simply doesn't have it [4/x]
        4) It requires DCI interface enabled in firmware, there's no mass marked devices (only debug boards) that have it by default [5/x]
