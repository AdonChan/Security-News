        PowerShell logging is so simple, turn it on even if you have no analysis capacity. It's a critical retrospective investigation source. 
        I heard from incident responder - they turned on PS logging and they rekt attackers across the network, who thought they were hidden. 
        PowerShell transcription logging is spooled in memory and written out in batches to simple text files. It's not a performance issue.

        Using GRC, we can design and understand simplified asymptotically physically reversible mechanisms for carrying out digital logic.
