        By making every one of his tweets the dominant story of every news cycle, America is giving Trump the biggest bully pulpit in history https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820279570804903941 ... 
        Doing real accountability reporting on Trump takes work and is critical. Responding to all his dumb tweets is easy, lazy and useless. https://twitter.com/paleofuture/status/820281936207757312 ... 
        Worth adding: responding to tweets isn't journalism. It seems some in the media don't really understand that.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820282944694714368 ... 
        This is what Trump understands -- the hyper-focus on his tweets, rather than on reporting or organizing opposition, intensifies his power.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820280870976323585 ... 
        @paleofuture Imagine: instead of devoting print/energy to daily tweet-fits, press maintains consistent pressure on Sessions/Tillerson/DeVos
        Don't misconstrue this. Reporting on Trump and organizing is critical. But obsessing over every one of his tweets is not. It only helps him.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820279570804903941 ... 
        Valuable: Trump-focused journalism & organizing
        Theres mass economic suffering & a climate crisis threatening human survival - maybe focus on that rather than his latest offensive tweethttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820289427440304132 ... 
        Translation of almost every Trump tweet: "Look over here at this thing, not at all the other stuff I don't want you paying attention to!"
        Respectfully: the consequences of obsessing over dumb tweets rather than doing hard work of organizing opposition haven't been great, eitherhttps://twitter.com/bill_auclair/status/820292607016194052 ... 
        Idea: Everytime u feel impulse to tweetstorm a burn of a Trump tweet, instead spend that time on something real to organize real opposition
        Here's a good guide for the kinds of real stuff that can be more valuable than a righteous tweetstorm: https://www.indivisibleguide.com/ https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820295595415977985 ... 
        Fascinating argument here that Internet-enhanced customization & personalization is intensifying political divisionhttp://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/self-segregation-military-facebook-college-diversity ... 
        The day Trump nominated Tillerson shoulda been a day scrutinizing Exxon. But Trump met with Kanye & THAT was the news cycle. U see his game?
        This. Trump's tweets are not a viable resistance pressure point & distract from horrible things his admin & Congress are actually doing.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820279570804903941 ... 
        Tillerson and Kanye happened in the same news cycle.  Trump is playing us like a violin. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/13/trump-announces-intends-to-nominate-tillerson-for-secretary-state.html ...  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/kanye-trump-tower-visit.html?_r=0 ... https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/820298892327682049 ...

        One thing people should keep in mind about 2020 is that weird billionaires and celebrities are right now saying to themselves, 'why not me?'
        And it's actually a good question. If Trump can do it, then why not some other random celebrity or rich person?
        So politicians who want to run for President, or even something else, should consider that. The big competitive advantage they have is this.
        Politicians can use public power to help people. And they can run for office based on that claim. That's the competitive advantage.
        So anyone selling out public policy favors in return for small bits of money is torching their pitch for staying in office vs rich weirdo.
        Standing up to power and organizing people like @bbond suggests may ironically and increasingly become the way to stay *in* power.
        Competition for politicians will increasingly not just be other politicians, but random rich bored billionaire.
        Running Starbucks doesn't qualify you for office, neither does being a shitty Senator. So unless you have a billion dollars do a good job.

        Age gets you in the end, but what gets you in the medium term are bad habits whose consequences you blame on age.
        One way to tell what you're suited for is to ask yourself what other people seem unaccountably indifferent to.
        One of the most dangerous things to lose as you get older is your willingness to look like a fool.

        It's really hard to take HN seriously on security when literally nobody has heard of a disassembler.
        words still mean things
        Who's a good person to ask a benign hardware token security question to at Github?
        I get people not understanding  software security audits.  I don't understand how a software developer can think an exe is opaque.

        If you want to scale crypto up to 2**30 people, you're going to need some centralization in the key management, and a low-false-positive UX.
        If those noncitizen workers don't want to cooperate w/any wacky unethical  plans their bosses might hatch to turn over data to Trump
        They can quit - I'm sure some have pledged to do so (see @neveragaintech) but then they have to leave. Like, immediately leave the US.
