        And it wants DJB's libnacl. Yeah, you know where this is going... 2/N
        libnacl has a "creative" build system that's a giant shell script with hard-coded LD_LIBRARY_PATHS for ancient proprietary unices. WTF. 3/N
        Eventually I found libsodium, which is a portable fork of nacl that's actually possible to build, and convinced curvetun to link to it. 4/N
        But curvetun had some bogus stuff using stdout/stderr as lvalues to overwrite them I had to rip out.... 5/N
        And after all that, it doesn't seem to work. TCP mode rapidly connects and drops, with no output indicating why. UDP nothing. 6/N
        Guessing it's weird glibcisms or something going on. Anyone used curvetun linked to musl? 7/N
        On the bright side, managed to make tcp-in-tcp less hellish using netem. 8/N
        tc qdisc add dev wlan0 root netem delay 5ms # 9/N
        Apparently most/all of the wifi collisions stemmed from receipt of a pkt on one wlan interface immediately generating pkts on another? 10/N

        Toomey could be the deciding vote on DeVos.  His office for Pennsylvania callers: (610) 434-1444.
        Betsy DeVos is tougher on bears than any Eduction Secretary in history. Weak Democrats opposed to her want our children eaten by bears.
        We have no comment at this time on rumors that the President is considering Fredrick Douglass for a cabinet position.
        Frederick Douglass is one of the greatest African-Americans. He will make history someday. The best.
        The President believes Susan B. Anthony is a terrific woman. Very smart and capable.
        The President admires Albert Einstein, who is one of the best Jewish Americans. Very smart, like the @POTUS.
        Least disturbing development of the day.https://twitter.com/AP/status/826939062711939081 ... 
        The President will not allow Russian aggression in the Ukraine to distract him from the crises he is creating with Australia and Mexico.
        We would like to assure all Americans concerned about our relations with Australia and Mexico that Hillary Clinton had an email server.
        Thinking that the airport protests were a real disaster for Trump whereas the Berkeley one played into his hands.
        In light of recent events, the President is recalling our ambassador to Australia from Vienna.

        Amazing, real Bloomberg headlinehttps://twitter.com/davidgura/status/827158679229177859 ... 
        Problem is not that some businesswoman will enable Trump. Problem is that she has too much power & her decision screws over the rest of us.https://twitter.com/jeffspross/status/827167567752155136 ... 
        ... also, the idea that she was ever (and may still be!) a progressive icon is absurd and illustrates the problem of token liberalism.
        One silver lining to the Hamilton craze is the exposure it has given to @WilliamHogeland's excellent book:https://www.amazon.com/Whiskey-Rebellion-Washington-Challenged-Sovereignty/dp/0743254910/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485983678&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Whiskey+Rebellion+William+Hoagely ... 
        What they *really* don't get is how finance and fascism relate.https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/827174666901008384 ... 
        Sectarian conflict is as old as humanity. Modern finance is just 350 years old.
        People rightly associate fascism with the Holocaust. They don't associate it with the interwar years and banker deals. It's both.
        Polish political economist Michal Kalecki situated fascism well with this 1943 essay. http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/kalecki220510.html ... 
        Fascism also changes, it keeps up with different social notions of race and ethnicity. It operates within different financial systems.
        John Maynard Keynes became famous for his 1919 book predicting a strongman in Germany because of treaty of Versailles economic sanctions.
        There's a 90 day notice requirement; Trump has broken his promise to start renegotiating NAFTA w/in first 100 days.https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-to-talk-with-its-private-sector-before-nafta-negotiations-1485989282 ... 
        This is not a big deal, it's just that I figured someone should keep track of this.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/827207804469538816 ... 
        Keep in mind NAFTA was really bad for a lot of poor Mexican farmers. Some are happy Trump wants to tear it up.http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/mexicans-left-nafta-opportunity-trump-170201073233264.html ... 
        Also Peter Navarro is right to point the finger at Germany and the Euro, as well as global fragile supply chains.https://www.ft.com/content/57f104d2-e742-11e6-893c-082c54a7f539 ... 
        It goes back much further; the U.S. chose to damage its own industrial base and middle class from the 1950s on to cement a global order.
        The deindustrialization was policy. Germany benefitted. Japan benefitted. Wall Street benefitted. American workers lost from 1968 onward.
        NAFTA and the opening to China in the 1990s built on this in ways that were terribly destructive. But the dynamic was there before.
        Majority disapprove of Trump executive orders in Gallup poll. That's decidedly worse for Trump than YouGov/Reuters.pic.twitter.com/FODcwhcEQf

        Running the country is much harder than convincing credulous people to vote for you.
        In Germany in 1937 you could tell good people by how they treated Jews. In the US in 2017 you can tell by how they treat Muslims.

        I suppose I shouldn't be so nationalist, but it worries me that a bad president may weaken the US exactly when China is becoming strong.
        Are the Chinese bummed that Trump won, or rubbing their hands with glee? Pretty easy to answer that one.
