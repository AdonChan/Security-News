        A comedy writer getting fired for a joke blows, but what happened to  Katie Rich has nothing to do with Trump, who doesn't own NBC.
        It's about corporate structure and the rigidity that's enforced. No matter how funny you are, working in corporate comedy makes you a cog.
        You're there to serve its needs. This is especially true with SNL. Image trumps content; if content sullies the image, it'll be flushed.
        Social media has made this more acute.
        Katie Rich is not a victim of censorship; she's on the receiving end of  business as usual. I wish her well, and suspect she'll do fine.

        New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become.
        I was taught that the human brain was the crowning glory of evolution so far, but I think it's a very poor scheme for survival.

        I mean, sure. You CAN.

        I don't know whether I'll have the energy to tell my Trump-voting family "I told you so" when Trump flames out and/or Pence becomes emperor.
        So if Neo-Nazis are "alt-right" and lies are "alt-facts", does that mean Trumpy "alt-won" the popular vote?
        I dream of a world where the truth is what shapes people's politics, rather than politics shaping what people think is true.

        Good Morning!https://vine.co/v/evpPAxEMu1B 
        Now that I'm getting into event filtering, I really do wish I understood algorithms on a fundamental level to understand performance impact.
        Like, how are "contains" filters implemented? Are they daisy-chained? Are they merged somehow? Are 2 rules 2x the CPU load? I don't know.
        @SwiftOnSecurity The problem here is that you may find a plethora of different "contains" implementations. From utterly naive to highly sophisticated.
        I get very anxious because computers operate one bit at a time I'm asking it to do thousands of tiny things and I don't know how bad that is
        Like, computers operate at a speed the human mind cannot fully conceive even in abstract but I still worry about each little bit idk
        @swiftonsecurity this keeps me awake at night sometimes.
        I should become an assembly programmer.
        @SwiftOnSecurity the important thing is the computer won't hate you for it until you program it to.

        Mute Signal, mute Whatsapp 
        Imho the problem with signal is only partially the UX it is more the fact it is unreliable

        1. I just asked prospective FTC chair Maureen Ohlhausen at a Heritage conference about Trump's potential use of antitrust to promote jobs.
        2. She said 'not to be callous' but that she was 'concerned about importing other values' into competition law.
        3. So essentially Trump cutting a deal with, say, Bayer to create American jobs when buying Monsanto should not find support at the FTC.
        4. Key point is if Trump's antitrust people are lax on mergers, the resulting mass layoffs will cut against Trump's jobs agenda.

        The Guardian has given every bad actor a lesson on how to discredit secure messaging. It's vital they retract this story.
        Shorter Brooks: Dear women, stop focusing on issues that affect the entire course of your life https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/opinion/after-the-womens-march.html ... pic.twitter.com/ym1cvJPVuk
        Alex Stamos is a trustworthy bad-ass, but the Yahoo story about the limits and failures of security leadership.https://boingboing.net/2017/01/23/facebook-cso-alex-stamos-is-a.html ... 
        It's unlikely anyone could have done any better than Stamos at Yahoo. And that's the problem. Post facto resignation is cold comfort.
        Better that we have a reliable human warrant canary than nothing. But far better than that: A MOBILIZED, RESISTING, ENGAGED TECH WORK FORCE.
        We can't depend on great leaders to protect people. We must depend on each other, on a newly principled engineering profession.

        CONFIDE doesn't notify you when somebody photoshops a fake message from you praising @maggieNYT's understanding of secure messaging
        There's a whole community of crypto engineers that private make fun of bad secure messaging services.
        They might need to stop talking behind those backs and start being more public about their skepticism and concerns.
        It's freaky how big the gulf is between crypto experts and the tech community at large -- forget about the broader user community.
        .@tadmanter Those report cards are so fraught. EFF's scorecard did much more harm than good.
        How in the fuck is it 2017 and I can't right-click to encrypt a file on stock OS X?
        .@TomRLancaster FULL DISK ENCRYPTION IS NOT A SUBSITUTE FOR FILE ENCRYPTION.
