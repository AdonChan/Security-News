        Last year, Oman accepted 10 Guantanamo detainees as well. And five more in 2015.
        Announcement on the 10 #Guantanamo  detainees released to Oman was made by Oman's foreign ministry. No word yet  from the Pentagon.

        CBO wrongly over-estimated a quick return to 5% interest rates for the last decade. That's not a neutral posture.https://twitter.com/loriamontgomery/status/820842303384387584 ... 
        This notion that we need Mommy and Daddy to tell us The Truth when the future is actually unknowable is absurd.
        CBO's projections on foreclosure mitigation programs were insanely wrong. And this is very harmful when writing laws.
        CBO should be an advisory board at best, and partisan. It should not be The Voice of God on the Hill, which is what its proponents want.
        Sorry, there's no Santa Claus. You can't pull the politics out of politics, even if Alice Rivlin makes nice charts.https://twitter.com/loriamontgomery/status/820844211419365376 ... 
        There's a piece I want to write about how the Lochner era has been reconstructed through five institutions: Fed, CBO, OIRA, FTC, DOJ
        From what I understand, the Lochner era was all about courts creating a legal loop of natural unchangeable laws of political economy.
        Anything allowing democratic institutions to challenge them (like child labor laws, etc) was contra natural law and thus unconstitutional.
        We've essentially recreated that through the 'natural law' of economics. And economists control our political economy through those five.
        FTC --> antitrust
        And anything that challenges the politics of economists who assert power through their pseudo-scientific aesthetics is contra natural law.
        So democracy can't touch money, corporations, banks, or labor questions. Other than that vote your little hearts out while we make charts.
        Now had economists been right, avoided the financial crisis and guided us into an era of wondrous prosperity well maybe it'd be different...
        I think Naomi Klein also noted this phenomenon in The Shock Doctrine's chapter on post-apartheid South Africa.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/820846922353229824 ...

        Installing Wire to try this out with a friend. Early report: Wire is very pretty.
        Very, very pretty and incredibly unintuitive. Friend had to send a screenshot to show me how to verify.
        Already a big problem is no user suggestion that they verify at all; verifying gets you BONUS UI, but not verifying gives no red flags.
        Giant blocking warning when friend reinstalls and comes back online that his key changed.
        Looks like: drops the earlier messages in flight, blocks the one sent when friend comes back online.
        That's not optimal but NOT what the Medium article says.

        So far leaning towards the belief that the Medium article is extremely unfair to Wire.
        (reminder to Wire partisans: I didn't write that article or know who did; just thought it was a smart case study)
        At this point me and @zmanian could go looking for verification bugs and probably find SOMETHING wrong, but that's not premise of article.
        Lie gets half around the world &c &c so I deleted recommendation for that article; would like to hear from @pepe_le_phew. What happened?
        I'd say that if verification needs to be bidirectional to work, @pepe_le_phew should issue CORRECTION; if unidirectional, a RETRACTION.
