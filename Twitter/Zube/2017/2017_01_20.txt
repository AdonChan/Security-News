        Note: It appears large number of failed Win7->Win10 upgrades were due to bad drivers. Microsoft is taking a more active role in pushing them
        Further evidence that relying on the customer or ecosystem to manage hardware properly and keep them maintained will burn you a decade later
        Drivers are not set-it-and-forget-it. I've learned this from a decade of managing desktops. They are buggy crap software that needs patching
        @SwiftOnSecurity Having worked on GPU drivers it was slightly horrifying to realize that most Windows users apparently NEVER updated them.
        .@linuxishawt @Eradik You're right, Intel drivers are something I should have mentioned as worth getting direct from them. I do that often.

        Now that Steve Mnuchin is being nominated, Ron Wyden suddenly cares about the foreclosure fraud he didn't pay attention to for six years.
        It's outrageous that Wall Street will have so much power in a Trump administration. They will clearly bail out banks and let off executives.
        Wyden pushes back on this "unprecedented obstruction" Hatch claims. In fact, Wyden waived a Committee rule requiring 1-wk notice for hearing
        Wyden was probably the key Senator pushing the TPP. He also gutted Trade Adjustment Assistance in one of the sleazier moves I've seen.
        And Andrew Mellon!https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/822103906671067139 ... 
        In 2015, Wyden voted down assistance for trade hit workers. Then when it was clear it would go down, he switched his vote so he'd look good.
        Horrible. I suspect such actions will result in a populist backlash that will elevate some evil little schmuck into office after him.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/822103273561800706 ... 
        Kansas GOP Senator Pat Roberts tells the Democrats to take a valium. Sherrod Brown gets mad. Very snappy.
        For years almost no Dems cared about the abuse heaped on foreclosures victims by banks and Geithner. Now they are a useful political prop.
        This is undeniable. Yesterday's hearing with homeowners was the first in Washington in years.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/822108855647645696 ... 
        fixable foreclosure is stain on obama years, enraging they won't come to terms with it. adminsitration's over, cop to it

        So it is definitely a bad thing that this selfie app is sending IMEIs to remote sites, but if you think this is rare you're very wrong
        You can check app permissions in Android under settings/apps/(app)/permissions and then hit the the top right buttons and do all permissions
        Anything that has "read phone status and identity" can read your IMEI. (although many apps will have that permission for other reasons too)
        You can disable that access on Android 6 and later by unchecking the phone option on the app's permission page.
        (this may result in the app crashing)
        If you install Permissions Explorer from the Play store, you can just tap PHONE_IDENTITY to get a list of all apps that have this permission
        But! The same permission is also required to know if you're in a call, so may have nothing to do with reading your IMEI
        And apps targeting Android 6 or later won't have that permission until they prompt you for it
        Basically it's all a fucking mess

        As for defending pic-in-pic attack: that was the primary reason I insisted we stick to KDE - It's Expose-like effects provided good defense.
        Ultimately we couldn't bare KDE's clumsiness, so switched to @xfceofficial. Sadly it doesn't have Expose and one needs to use Alt-Tab.
        Still works, but I wish @xfceofficial implemented an Expose-like switcher some day. It makes avoiding pic-in-pic attacks more natural.
