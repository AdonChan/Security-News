        At times (Drug War, domestic surveillance), libertarians offer more sense than liberals. This holds for Meryl Streep.http://bit.ly/2i5RX6y 
        Streep championed journalistic freedom, but so far as I know said nothing  when Obama cracked down on whistleblowers at a record clip.
        Trump is an asshole, but Hollywood liberals and millionaires are not heading to the gulag. Who do you think produced THE APPRENTICE?
        If anxious liberals are looking to celebrities to save us, then it's gonna be a looooong four years.
        If more of life were a red carpet ceremony, we might finally come together and show respect for what the other person's wearing.

        Trump's great weakness may turn out to be that he always has to "be himself," that he can't adapt.
        If so, the way to defeat him is to put him in a situation where being himself will destroy him.
        An ordinary moderately wise person would see through such a trap, but Trump will dig himself in deeper.
        But we have to choose the situation more carefully than the Democrats did during the election.
        It has to be one where by digging himself in deeper, he does actually harm himself, rather than making himself more popular with his base.
        The good news is, winning the election will have given him much more confidence that following his instincts will always work.
        If so, becoming president will strangely enough have made him weaker.
