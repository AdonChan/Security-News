        Facebook needs an army of bots to post spoilers in the comments on clickbait and snopes in the comments on fake news.
        If you're a Black person involved in open source software, then I highly recommend applying to attend! http://sourceroadsummit.com/ 
        Defuse the impulse of curiosity before ppl click and watch ad revenue from these deceptive techniques plummet.
        Bots just need to follow all the biggest sources of spammy content & reply in a manner that doesn't look too bot-like.
        But then even if they do get caught as bots, FB is put in the position of looking like they're treating a good deed as a banable offense.

        The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention.
        The report serves a few limited purposes, namely setting forth the areas of factual agreement between the agencies.
        1. The big one. Did any US Person, connected or unconnected with Trump campaign, have knowledge of, procure or participate in the operation?
        2. If the answer to the question above is anything other than "We have found no evidence of that" is there an ongoing investigation?

        Guys, WikiLeaks is VERY CONCERNED classified information is being leaked.https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/817322050297745408 ... 
        Solaris people: is it possible /dev/random on Solaris reads RAW ENTROPY BYTES directly from a kernel buffer? http://src.illumos.org/source/xref/illumos-gate/usr/src/uts/common/crypto/api/kcf_random.c#1090 ... 
        Follow kcf_rnd_get_bytes to rnd_get_bytes, first if-condition, rndc_getbytes. 
        For instance: here's raw timer information being passed to rndc_addbytes, which just XORs it into the rndbuf. http://src.illumos.org/source/xref/illumos-gate/usr/src/uts/common/crypto/api/kcf_random.c#151 ...

        Again, reporters quoting Jeffrey Carr as if an equally credible source. /cc @emptywheel 
        Maybe he should be quoted! But his background in the field should be interrogated, because experts I ask about him respond: "!?!?!?!?"
        Is the deal that each indirected entropy "provider" outside the RNG source does its own mixing?
