        I was at both the Inauguration and today's #WomensMarch, and the latter had a much bigger crowd, which I hope bodes well for resistance.
        Team Trump not happy with Sean Spicer, replacing him with Tim Tebow.
        Trump is globally despised on his first day. That usually gets you fired. #WomensMarch

        Hey @SamuelGibbs, what's the number of security experts calling your coverage baseless needed to get a retraction? I like having a goal
        If you compete with the Guardian and do serious tech journalism, I have a list of seventy people who would enjoy talking to you
        (to the extent that security experts can enjoy anything)
        @Pinboard @SamuelGibbs you were misled which is not a problem. Now world+dog telling you are in the wrong, so do the right thing
        If this were a similarly flawed story on vaccines or climate change, rebutted by experts, the Guardian would have pulled it days ago
        I would threaten a boycott of tech experts against talking to the Guardian, but that won't work since you don't appear to interview any

        It's very true that, with or without Trump, police can be major threats to many of the same people threatened by the Trump admin. 2/N
        At the same time, tho, having the police choose to side with the people is a huge help in resisting and winning against fascist regimes. 3/N
        It's especially important in the context of Trump's attempt to appeal to LEOs as being "on their side", against "anti-police sentiment". 4/N
        This is an advantage you can almost never wield vs a foreign/other oppressor, only against home-grown ones. 5/N
        Reminds me of the end of Milosevic and how that contrasted with situations in other countries. 6/N
        psssssst if the women's march blocking traffic and snarling transit today didn't bug you, but BLM did? interrogate yourself as to why.

        Q: is WhatsApp crypto broken?
        Q: I am paranoid, what should I use?
        Pizzini are, in effect, messages written in a private shared language which is only known to the endpoints and have a long delivery chain... 
        of multiple carriers with know knowledge of both endpoints or, indeed, other members of the chain. Reaching endpoints is difficult as is... 
        uncovering the whole chain. They are used, amongst other things, to communicate with jailed Mafia bosses and even knowing and endpoint has... 
        proved futile in both decryption and breaking the chain by Italian anti-mafia (DIA) with a few exceptions. The crux is in the obscure... 
        shared language between the endpoints, the brevity of the message (often one sentence or less) defeating depth, and the long manual chain... 
        Before you start shouting "we can do digital pizzini!": no you cannot. The carriers are /not/ oblivious to each other and you can join the... 
        dots with, yep, metadata. Real pizzini "burn" metadata after one hop requiring the /whole/ chain to find out who is speaking to whom.
        Also, carriers are often trusted family. Indeed most comms breaches only occurred after some family member became a "pentito" ("repentant")... 
        and gave up the code and/or most of the chain. Again, this does not happen often nor ar pizzini intercepted as easily as digital comms... 
        Translated: use paper. Use pen.

        It is okay to not trust Facebook, Apple and Google.
        It is also okay to say that @guardian story about a WhatsApp backdoor is nonsense. It is equal nonsense to sign "there is NO BACKDOOR"
        There are some cool people working for Apple security. Doesn't change fact they still pressure companies into non-disclosure in 2017.
        It is so funny how term "security nihilist" a term coined by Facebook employees is used to attack people who don't blindly trust Facebook

        .@matthewstoller honest Q: why is this a "bad" thing? Foundations and lobbying etc are how politics works? Every former president has one?
        @TealWillingham @matthewstoller that this is how politics works IS "a bad thing." That's what the #BernieRevolution was about.
        @matthewstoller but my larger point is mounting an attack on Obama is not smart politics for Sanders wing. Swallow this pill.

        So many vitally important projects and organisations run by so many trash people
        The idea that we should thank police for not attacking protesters seems based on the idea that it's normal for police to attack protesters
        When you're grateful that the armed wing of the state isn't attacking innocent people, maybe you're in a pretty bad place
        This bulb, uh, sends base64 encoded commands over Bluetooth LE?
        ... now it's generating a 128 bit AES key by doing FNV1a on an 8 digit string
        WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
        Of *course* there's no FNV1a-128 implementation in Python
        It not only sends base64 encoded commands, they have to be terminated with \r\n
        Weirdly, the app doesn't seem to handle rgbw even though the bulb appears to implement it
        There is a *very* non-linear response curve on these LEDs
