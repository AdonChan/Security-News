        Important clarification. This does *not* prevent Trump admin from blocking new travelers.https://twitter.com/JessicaHuseman/status/825525603491278848 ... 
        Now that @ACLU won stay, will airlines permit green card & visa holders to board planes to US?
        Much easier for Trump to make life worse for those he promised to hurt than it will be to make life better for those he promised to help.
        Buzzfeed has posted a copy of the stay order:https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-judge-orders-halt-to-deportations-under-trump-order?utm_term=.vo9bvEo66#.qoBj498vv ... 
        ...  my (nonlawyerly) read of the order is that it applies to anyone (with visa, etc) who makes it to US airport ...  @ACLU
        ...  which means that *airlines* now have significant gatekeeping role in their discretion to let someone board or not. @ACLU
        Also, would @ACLU order apply to gc/visa holder who flies to Canada tomorrow and walks to US border?
        .@AuerbachKeller @ACLU Why? I've heard people say this on twitter, but I'm hoping to be pointed to a legal analysis of the order.

        The green card application asks if you were a Nazi between 1939-45. Being a Nazi in 2017 will be construed as evidence of patriotism
        Any Democrat in the Senate who votes for Jeff Sessions is not a Democrat to me anymore.
        We're urging Senate to cancel vote on Sessions atty general nom based on his reported involvement in executive orders signed by Trump today
