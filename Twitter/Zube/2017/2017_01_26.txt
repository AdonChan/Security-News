        Voting system security is a genuine problem that we've needed to better address for years, and we shouldn't lose sight of this in the noise.

        Scientists doing science is not "going rogue." Authoritarians telling scientists they can't do science--that is going rogue.

        Muslim ban is going to be implemented in stages; refugees are the low hanging fruit because they can't defend themselves.
        Mr. President, 
        Of all the groups to scapegoat and vilify, scapegoating and vilifying refugees fleeing the horror of war is about as low as it gets.

        There are some remaining remote code execution problems with the WebEx 1.0.5 update. I've just sent a full report & exploit to Cisco. 
        Back in my day, we called programs executing arbitrary commands "shells", but now I'm hearing kids call them "video conferencing software".
        Nearly all were remote code execution and there's one very nasty looking exploit for full network compromise cc @tavisohttps://twitter.com/iblametom/status/824272770829811712 ...

        I'm sure the timing of this tweet is sheer coincidence.https://twitter.com/deptofdefense/status/824240417885429760 ... 
        Violent crime spike in Chicago concentrated in just 5 (of 77) neighborhoods: E/W Garfield Park, Fuller Park, Burnside, and Englewood.
        (This according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab project)
        Those 5 neighborhoods are overwhelmingly black, but account for just 8% of the population and a small fraction of city's black population.
        Two of those neighborhoods, East and West Garfield Park, are on the West Side. The others are on the south side.
        For history of those neighborhoods, strongest possible recommendation for Ta Nehisi Coates's "Case For Reparations":http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/ ... 
        Contrary to popular belief, Chicago is #18, not #1, in murder rate among metro areas.
        But Chicago has had an anomalous spike in gun violence, esp. compared to largest cities in US.
        But only/principally in those areas of the city Ta-Nehisi Coates discusses, housing less than 1/4 of city's black population.
        @tqbf Let me throw in http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674018211 ...  andhttp://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo20832325.html ... 
        You should also, obviously, know that when O'Reilly and Trump use the term "carnage" to describe "Chicago", that's a racial dog whistle.
        Hell, as long as I'm throwing out book titles, of course you have to go with https://www.amazon.com/South-Side-Portrait-American-Segregation/dp/1137280158 ...  and http://us.macmillan.com/ghetto/mitchellduneier/9780374161804 ...  cc @tqbf
        "White hat hackers" are in fact not routinely victimized by CFAA. Source: white hat hacker.https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/824286113699336192 ... 
        There are 18 zillion groups of people more in need of relief from criminal persecution than computer nerds.
        The great problem of CFAA is its sentencing: it scales with "damage", which for CFAA crimes is the induction variable in your for() loop.
        That's a problem but a part of a much more important problem, which is INSANE sentencing rules and the perverse incentives they create.
        People doing offensive security research for career do so with high likelihood of gainful employment, low likelihood of prosecution.
        If you care about CFAA, you should care more about mass incarceration. No better read than Pfaff: http://harvardjol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/HLL104_crop1.pdf ...
