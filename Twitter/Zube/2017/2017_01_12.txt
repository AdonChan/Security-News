        There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too.
        Life happens too fast for you ever to think about it. If you could just persuade people of this, but they insist on amassing information.
        Any man can call time out, but no man can say how long the time out will be.

        Hello journalist friends! It's Senate confirmation week; consider not spending your time on lurid Trump drama now. Stop getting played.
        What does it matter that a man got peed on in Moscow if he's about to shit on the country?
        At this point, the only kind of incriminating evidence that could discredit Trump would be footage of him reading Derrida in the original
        @Pinboard and miss all the @wikileaks puns? Not humanly possible.
        to be clear if getting peed on is your preferred pound this can still prove love. i do not look down on the preferred pounds of others

        A few weeks ago, I promised to describe a (AFAIK) new weakness in Telegram. No time for a blog post, so here's a bunch of tweets. (1/7)
        According to the Telegram specification, Forward Secrecy re-keying in Telegram is actually a 2-RTT exchange: https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/pfs ...  (2/7)
        Inefficiency aside, this allows Telegram server to undetectably prevent Telegram chats from obtaining any forward secrecy whatsoever. (3/7)
        The server has three methods to cancel forward secrecy in a way that does not suggest any server interference to Alice or Bob: (4/7)
        Server can drop Alice's decryptedMessageActionRequestKey, Bob's-decryptedMessageActionAcceptKey or decryptedMessageActionCommitKey. (5/7)
        Last method is the worst: it gives server plausible deniability: spec *explicitly* allows Alice/Bob to indefinitely delay CommitKey. (6/7)
        Also found other attacks in Telegram but they are implementation-specific. That's all for now, hope it's not boring. (7/7)

        Thanks. @POTUS, for your powerful, understated decency.
        Must say, I disagreed with many of his policies & thought a few monstrous, but Obama was great at projecting America's best image of itself.
        Whereas I don't expect Trump's speeches to reflect anything but our most venal & base impulses. The American id.
        I'm truly impressed by this speech. Generous, humble, upbeat, and yet unflinching about the task ahead.
        Jan 10, 2017: The outgoing President delivers an inspiring speech of unity.

        16. ""There's not too many mom-and-pop stores left around here. You can thank the government for that." 
        17. Democrats used to defend mom and pop stores against chain retailers. Now? Democrats don't even know there's a problem.
        18. If you bring up that communities are in trouble, immediately it's 'but we expanded health care'. Let them eat transfer payments.
        19. Dems didn't cause all of these problems. They are a function of concentrated financial power. But Dems were elected to deal with them.
        20. And the 'why won't the gop expand Medicaid plus I love Amazon it's inevitable anyway culture culture culture JD Vance' is an obstacle.
        21. People are lonely and decisions are made for them by distant uncaring elites. Result is they suffer, die, and/or turn to strongmen.
        22. The GOP benefitted. But do keep in mind Trump first destroyed the Bush family. So there was a revolt against the GOP establishment.
        23. What is so disturbing about so many Democrats is that they just don't think they did anything wrong. They don't even see a problem.
        @RBarone7 @matthewstoller @pilartimpane I live in Florida, in a district Obama won twice, and on my ballot many Repubs are unchallenged. Dems around here are absent or as bad as Rs

        Trump is going to privatize and destroy the VA.

        The VA has problems but it largely delivers good care. Handing it over the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics execs to gouge is apparently the plan.
        In Trump's presser he talks about insourcing, going after big pharma, and privatizing the VA. Yet not a single question on any of those.
