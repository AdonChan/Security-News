        Two non-maneuverable satellites have 44% odds of colliding head-on tonight over S. Pole. Welcome to 2017! http://spaceflight101.com/close-orbital-encounter-january-7-2017/ ...

        After Inauguration Day, Trump will be able to use US surveillance capacity to selectively leak his adversaries' private correspondence.
        Journalists need to ask ourselves how we are going to cover those disclosures when they start popping up on Wikileaks or wherever.
        Don't forget. Hackers dumped internal strategy docs of candidates they disliked in primaries--then in general. Only Dems. Media lapped it up.https://twitter.com/erikaheidewald/status/809264725942906880 ... 
        In many competitive house races, a hacker sat on twitter and DM'ed stolen docs ONLY of Dems to media and opponents. Barely discussed.
        Well, this is awkward.pic.twitter.com/FfzdeM9XWY

        ACT II: IBM employees respond with a petition demanding IBM follow its own ethics rules, garnering 800 signatures:https://www.coworker.org/petitions/ibmers-to-ceo-ginni-rometty-affirm-ibm-values ... 
        ACT III: IBM makes a tiny change to its logo, elegantly solving the problem.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/6/ibm-unveils-rainbow-logo-in-solidarity-with-lgbt-c/ ... 
        If there are any additional signs of worker unrest at IBM, the board stands ready to bring in renowned logo-tweaker Marissa Mayer
        If you like your logo the way it is, a good alternative way to signal support for your LGBTQ workers is not to collaborate with Trump
        Imagine how that whole scenario would have played out if IBM had a union workforce.

        2. The question is whether you see an oligarchy of race, sexuality and gender as a subset of an oligarchy of aristocracy.
        3. Wall Street liberals do not. They want entrenched privilege, they just want it to be race and gender blind.
        4. Like all aristocrats, to them, man in inherently sinful and must be ruled by his betters. Thus, racism is neither learned nor eradicable.
        5. To Wall Street liberals, racism is a function of the lower class, instead of a part of an overall system of political economy.
        6. So the solutions, like education, are predicated upon lifting up the lower class. Of course, there are lots of very well educated racists
        7. The guiding premise here is that racism is a function of democracy, and thus must be overwhelmed by the guiding hand of the aristocrats.
        8. Populists see in racism, sexism, homophobia the need for democracy to overcome entrenched social and economic privilege.
        9. They see racism (and other biases) as a function of a lack of democracy, not as a function of it.
        10. Race, of course, is socially constructed. It's very weird that Americans discuss race under the 'one drop rule' premise of the 1800s.
        11. There's also the phrase 'people of color', which is sort of real but also sort of incoherent. It leads to mistaken assumptions.
        12. Like the belief that America is going to become 'minority white'. Uh, no. A political party will just change what whiteness means.
        13. Most of the -ism's are ever mutable, and change over time in response to different political economies. So when we needed labor...
        14. Race relations were organized with the context of an attempt to suppress wages until the 1970s. But mass offshoring changes the game.
        15. Today, globalization means labor suppression is done with global labor arbitrage, not domestic labor arbitrage. Lots of implications.
        16. Anyway, what is most difficult to grasp is that aristocracy is not a function of skin color, gender, or sexuality.
        17. Wall Street liberals use atomized libertarian identity as a means to express aristocratic ideas in a democratic culture.
        18. To them, structural racism/sexism/homophobia doesn't make sense. This is all a function of the sin of the lower classes.
        19. For populists, the problem is that just b/c race is a social construct, it doesn't make it not real. It's very real.
        20. And right now the language doesn't really exist to link the oligarchy of aristocracy to race/gender/sexual oppression.

        To everyone demanding more evidence from intelligence community re Russian hacks: 1/ You are not going to get it. It's intel, not a trial.
        2/ I'd love to see the actual evidence, personally. But we're not going to get to interview the human sources. We're not going to see SIGINT
        3/ And honestly, even if they showed people the figurative stigmata and put their fingers through them, some would still not believe.
        4/ most people would still need interpretation for them. And given how bad most MSM tech/security coverage is, they'd be dissatisfied.
        5/ the unclassified report isn't going to convince anyone who doesn't believe the @ThreatConnect @CrowdStrike @SecureWorks  analysis.
        6/ the weakest parts of the report are about @RT, mostly because they're the most obvious. OMG RT is propaganda 
        7/ so if you inherently distrust everything the intel community says, you're never going to be satisfied. And Putin you.
        8/ And those of us in the press who are both rightfully skeptical of the govt. and driven by data in our reporting will be frustrated 4ever.
        9/ but I can say that based on the data I've collected so far, and the input of people I trust outside govt, that the IC rpt is mostly right
        @thepacketrat The power  Russia has right now is that they control the narrative after being ousted due to public distrust. Putin puppets.
