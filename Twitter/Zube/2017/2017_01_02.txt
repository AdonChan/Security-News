        If I didn't already know it's the last day of the year, email from a million non-profits asking me to donate before midnight would tell me.
        Also, sorry cultural non-profits, but this year I've got to be more focused on human rights orgs.
        Many poor news stories come from reporters not taking "I don't know" for an answer, or sources being reluctant to give it.
        I had at least half a dozen press inquires asking if I think Russia has hacked the power grid.
        Thank you! This is the biggest fundraising day of the year in the US. 
        The trick is distinguishing between "I don't know" for boring reasons and "I don't know" for interesting reasons.
        Wherein we are reminded that the President-Elect has an enemies list.
        I'm especially disheartened that we're in a world (across the spectrum) where disagreement over, say, health care policy makes us "enemies".
        We've linguistically put people who disagree about the best value for a minimum wage in an equivalence class with terrorists.
        Now that it's 2017 (UTC, at least), I'm assuming all our problems are over and everything is fine now.
        My new year's resolution is to not lead a fascist takeover of a democracy.
        Also to promptly change my smoke detector batteries.
        I figure I can accomplish at least half of these.

        Maybe Trump found an 0day in the latest Windows or a new attack against AES or something. Whatever it is, I look forward to the paper.
        Of course, the timing makes me suspicious that Trump's big announcement will just be a rejected ShmooCon talk. But I'll wait and see.
        I'm guessing it involves a race condition.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/815451266264563712 ...

        To all followers, friends & everyone else I've communicated with throughout the past year: 
        My resolution for 2017 is to stop mourning the declining present and start fighting for the future I want to see.
        My thoughts are with #Istanbul and the victims of another massive attack on innocent civilians in what looks like terrorism.
        Hey @SonderDesign, got any updates on when you expect to start shipping your E-ink keyboard?

        The original story was dumb. The corrective follow-ups are dumb. Russia has absolutely owned up the electrical grid, as we have theirs.
        There is nobody in the industry who believes that state-level adversaries haven't comprehensively owned up our infrastructure.
        "The grid" itself might mean different things in context. But outcome the same: Russia has the ability to disrupt distribution of our power.
        Source: have been a part of commercial pentest teams that demonstrated similar results. If even WE could do it... 
        Further: to message board nerds:
        So far my favorite response. "There is a NERC standard that says this isn't true".https://twitter.com/unorigmoniker/status/815280173973143552 ... 
        JFC all these important things I say about politics & culture & the most banal possible point about cyber is the one that gets all the RTs.
        I'm a little worried about this, so let me be clear: I'm not a SCADA person, and my contact w/ this problem is incidental.
        I'm not one of those security nerds who blew up distribution stations out in the desert or whatever.
