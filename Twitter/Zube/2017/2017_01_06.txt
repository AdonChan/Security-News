        Thanks to all the audience members who sat through 2 hours of that and thanks to celebrity judges @window @michaelawsutton @JaredDeMott.

        If you're a Democrat defending the CIA, it means you're comfy with death squads and undermining governments. So what's your prob with Trump?

        The elder Bush was director of the CIA, yet I don't remember many Democrats celebrating that in 1988. They backed Dukakis. Traitors.

        @Pinboard I feel you, but joking aside, I'd be doing supporters a disservice if I didn't acknowledge how they managed to move opinion.
        @Pinboard For a bunch of folks, it's an issue they care a lot about, and some of these polls used to be 50%+ in favor of prosecution.
        it's getting me (slightly) down that all @pinboard tweets anymore is political derps. used to be all about the punk rock!https://twitter.com/pinboard/status/816770488093605888 ... 
        No one is sadder than me to see this Twitter account get all political
        @Pinboard That's snarky and not very constructive :(.  How about advice, empathy, etc.?
        I'll be hosting convo at @TechSolidarity this week in SF. Details in that feed. Also contact @pinboard on Signal.
        Nanoluthiers are still working on the violin I would need to play a sad dirge for Medium. It's hard to carve wood at sub-nanometer scales 
        Full credit to Evan Williams, though. Not many people can say they killed blogging twice
        @Pinboard if Dave Winer sees this he's going to write an angry post about how he invented killing blogging
        People saying that Medium is grossly overstaffed forget that it has one of the lowest employees/bytes served ratios in the industry
        Another winning NYT headline: "Trump and Assange, an Unlikely Pair, Sow Hacking Doubts".  Unlikely? After months of Assange helping Trump?
        The NYT should just run a permanent headline readng "We're Getting Played Again". Money-saving, and good for journalism
        I do hope Trump's 10 year old son turns out to be behind the Podesta hack.

        new Inkscape release!
        Done hacking veles for tonight. Added 2D polar projection, smooth scroll, 3D navigation using mouse & WASDQE and a couple minor tweaks.pic.twitter.com/1J6mImbNQ4
        Bad news for Inkscape on OS X :(pic.twitter.com/IRyvgE1o8H
        one of the exercise I'll cover in my #inkange workshop is to turn a few photographies in a schema: when a meeting is suddenly interrupted...
        ...and when you only have 5s to make a copy with your phone of that big schema you spent an hour deciding with your colleagues #inkange ...
        another thing covered in my #inkscape are quick tricks to make a vector image out of an ugly (jpeg artefacts, lo-res...) picture...
        ... when for example, you want to add a logo to your slide deck and you can only find ugly versions of it. #inkange
        an alternative version of that exercise is when you only have a single, grainy/lowlight picture of an object. #inkange ...
        another topic is how to extract a schema from a PDF doc, edit/modify it, and save it back as PDF #inkangehttps://twitter.com/angealbertini/status/770503518847397888 ... 
        another covered topic is how to make a poster like my binary file format posters. #inkange
        LMK if you have more suggestions ! #inkange cc @doegox @jaredcatkinson @OlivierGuinart @lorenzo2472

        Other great iOS share extension idea: if you don't like your attachments people can bid money to buy them from you.

        This is an important piece on how Democrats need to embrace liberty to beat back Trumpism.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/januaryfebruary-2017/democrats-must-become-the-party-of-freedom/ ... 
        The gist of it is that Americans relate to politics through the institutions that organize our lives - corporations.
        The key to reinvigorating a shattered party is to restore a core approach that every American can relate to - anti-monopoly and pro-liberty.
        Democrats did not pay attention to the commercial sphere, and allowed monopoly power to organize our lives. The party atrophied as a result.
        This was antithetical to the long anti-monopoly tradition of the Democratic Party, a tradition central to the party's very creation.
        What this meant is that Democrats had nothing to say about the key institutions that touch our lives, corporations.
        By embracing an anti-monopoly approach to politics, the Democrats can re-engage everywhere and embrace liberty on a fundamental level.

        Offensive infosec makes sense to military folks because they come from the modern kinetic realm, where weapons are stronger than armor.
        I believe--because of cryptography and computer science--that in the digital realm it is possible to make armor stronger than any weapon.

        After reading @pwnallthethings' take on why the DNC hacker wasn't a 14yr old https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/816621553643294720 ...  I had some thoughts about pentesters.
        .@pwnallthethings Increasingly, pentesters job is not only to show *whether* something is possible, but how hard it would be to replicate in a real attack.
        .@pwnallthethings This, conviniently for my business I'll admit, means you need to be able to own at the top end so you can contextualise an attack.
        .@pwnallthethings You need to know how long a strong attacker would take to replicate. And while there's always someone better, the closer you are the easier
        .@pwnallthethings On the flip side, you need to be able to understand how junior attackers would go at it, and how long it would take them.
        .@pwnallthethings Increasingly, the days of people being awed than an attack was possible are going, we need to explain how hard it was/is.

        (1) Okay, so shoveling through the public data on DNC, DCCC, WADA, and other breaches tied to Fancy ...there are some interesting patterns.
        (2)A lot of the techniques, tools and practices look a lot like sophisticated crimeware ops. But there are a few things that don't...
        (3) First, they used all these small, paid-for dedicated servers. Maybe they paid in BTC.
        (4) They used a very defined number of domain registrars (mostly bulletproof ones) and privacy services.
        (5) Do crimeware guys pay for their servers? Maybe. But these publicly dumped data, including financial info. Not very good criminals.
        (6) The same DNS registration data was used on multiple domains for multiple campaigns, spoofing domains used by targets. Recon.
        (7) The SCALE of things. The number of connected, spearphishing-specific domains that are connected.
        (8) The types of targets: DNC etc, think tanks, diplomatic, military, academic. Policy wonk hackers.
        (9) So, we have TTPs that are pretty common, apparent motive and scale of operations that are not, and a considerable investment.
        10) But if someone was just paying for all this...say, like a government agency...
        11) or a kleptocrat..
        12) Also, it seems like the hacking is separate from the information ops: Guccifer 2.0, DCLeaks, Fancy Bear HT are the media ops using data.
        13) Don't get the hackers and the "faketivists" mixed up. Somebody hacked the data. Somebody used the data. Those two are â‰ .
