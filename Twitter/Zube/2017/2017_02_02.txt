        True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.
        I have to say this in defense of humankind: No matter in what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got there.
        I feel and think much as you do,care about many of the things you care about,although most people don't care about them. You are not alone.

        In NZ it's easy to feel overwhelmed & powerless at the wave of horrifying news from the US. Here's 5 suggestions for things you can do 1/7
        @Pinboard Y Collaborator
        Were the Google protests a one-day thing? Has any other tech company stepped outside? Why was it only Googlers?
        If you're at Facebook, what are you thinking right now? Are you satisfied with the Sandberg statement that doesn't even mention Trump?
        To read most tech executives, the order barring refugees and immigrants was a mysterious calamity unconnected to the political process
        No one has the guts to say "I'm sorry I went and sat at the table with the man who is doing this terrible thing"
        Sheryl Sandberg statement: "My great-great-grandmother, Channa Bassa, would have had the guts to speak the truth"
        @Pinboard except the Canadians
        @Pinboard Sandberg knows that all the FB employees who matter can quickly make a deep learning neural net to figure out all she didn't say
        America's Next Top Jurist, tonight at 8 PM

        The left protest about Trump, but they're strangely silent about King Raedwald's invasion of Northumbria in AD 616
        Remember: they attack you at your weakest point. If you have a green card, and can move on to citizenship, don't make their job easier
        Standing Rock under Trump is a scary situation.http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/dakota-pipeline-oil-234468 ... 
        A colleague of mine, a Danish citizen, has been denied entry into the US because he excavates archaeological sites in Iraq. Really.

        Going to be uploading a public alpha of my sysmon config later today. Spent days of work researching stuff to include, tuning, and testing.pic.twitter.com/HW2S2aOBlg
        I've decided to make a SwiftOnSecurity github, just to make sure that none of my work appears on my resume.
        For example, here's my Sysmon RegistryEvent section. Documenting it as much as possible, work in progress. Wildcards extremely powerful.pic.twitter.com/tgAEH3AQ61
        I have to design every single entry for minimum performance impact, so it's a mix of techniques for cost:reward across all client computers.
        Unlike native Windows registry auditing, Sysmon has no concept of inheritance blocking or nested rules, so have to be very, very careful.
        The problem with native Windows registry auditing is how obtuse it can seem, and companies are scared of Group Policy. Sysmon is cleaner.
        Sysmon has no concept of HKCU or %UserProfile%, so all user-level monitoring must be done with "contains" or "end with"
        @swiftonsecurity Don't believe the hype. The original German article was already largely debunked. English here:https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-01/trump-s-secret-sauce-is-just-more-ketchup ... 
        Posted: Microsoft Sysinternals Sysmon configuration file.
        This configuration has lots of ideas in it, which I'm still refining and debating. All feedback welcome.
        Just download this config, run

        Well whoops my phone's been delivered to an office I'm not visiting for two weeks
        TIL @mjg59 made relatime the default in Linux 10 years ago. I've been superfluously setting it in my fstab the whole time.
        Day 2 and I'm reading the Authenticode spec again so this is going about as well as expected
        Actually skip that I'm going to have to resort to the EDK II code
        PLAGUE: Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100 percent. Okay?
        MARGO: But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
        No
        My walk home from the bus takes me down Gerry Adams Way and sometimes Oakland confuses me

        We have a term for eccentric billionaires holding hostage the future of the world's energy to their evil politics.
        Threads to primary out defecting Democrats would be more credible if they included a notion of who was going to run.
        The Tea Party famously bumped off Eric Cantor...  but from one of the redder districts in the House.
        Primary Feinstein, sure. (She will probably win; she's like the end-stage boss in US politics). But: no harm.
        But what's the Democratic bench and the climate look like in West Virginia to replace Manchin?

        Trump wants to ban Muslims but if we learned anything from Prohibition it's that people will just make Muslims in their bathtubs.
