        I really wonder what gives us the right to wreck this poor planet of ours.
        A sane person to an insane society must appear insane.
        The big trouble with dumb bastards is that they are too dumb to believe there is such a thing as being smart.

        This is how #SFO protests. 
        Oh shit, I forgot the Democrats! Someone tell the Democrats!
        Maybe the National Park Service, Teen Vogue, @TicTacUSA and airport lawyers don't have to do this on their own

        "Trump is terrible, so we must make sure he's surrounded with the best people!" is a kind of gild-the-turd morality.

        @Pinboard "Trump is terrible, so let's make sure we've got the best people opposing him at every step"
        @Pinboard Also not super convincing when he's actually surrounded by the worst people.

        The imagery here, as thousands of Americans mass at airports in urgent support of immigrants, is so incredibly stark.https://twitter.com/ivankatrump/status/825571008220430336 ... 
        Many liberals slept while Obama expanded watchlisting and violating of rights at airports. @ACLU fought it then too with little support.
        I hope every elected official and potential candidate for 2018 is taking note: if you want to know what policies to champion, follow @ACLU.https://twitter.com/dnvolz/status/825854514947317761 ... 
        Obviously Obama didn't do the same thing as Trump. But Trump is using Obama's terrible policy to justify his much, much worse policyhttps://twitter.com/micahflee/status/825850913004728321 ...

        Predictably, ISIS is cheering Trump's Muslim banhttp://wapo.st/2juKKZz 
        Actually, not just predictably--predicted, eg @MazMHussainhttp://bit.ly/2juHq0I 
        Yes, I know, it's not really a Muslim ban. You don't have to convince me. Convince the people ISIS is recruiting with it.
        Those bleating most ostentatiously about national security are the ones who create the most hazards--to the citizenry and to the republic.
        Causes huge liberal cognitive dissonance: "It's not just Trump but this mentality that needs vehement opposition"http://bit.ly/2kKeYx9

        North Dakota, Federal judges, global leaders, Senators - purity trolls are everywhere these days.
        *Annoying analysis forthcoming*
        Trump's base isn't unhappy with his actions so far, but what they really want is jobs. They will stay with him for now.
        If he delivers on jobs, Trump will be able to ride this out. If he doesn't, he will be left, not as Andrew Jackson, but as Andrew Johnson.
        The high-tech visa EO will help his base. The immigrant EO won't. If his econ plan doesn't work, Trump will be a President w/out a party.
        Losing influence means elites are willing to openly defy him. It makes it harder to govern. Politicians see the public doesn't like him.
        Federal judges are watching him attack their authority. Same with Congress, intel agencies, military, even his own cabinet members!

        @weldonwilliford @matthewstoller what's wrong? Silent Majority a little too silent, and not enough majority for you?

        A senior official at Uber tells me @travisk is going to D.C. to tell Trump in person that  the travel ban is wrong. More like this please.
        Debugging is your code forcing you to understand it.
        I think Trump may have interpreted the silence between the election and the inauguration as acquiescence.
        In fact it was because people were waiting to see if he'd be as bad a president as they feared.
        Now that it's clear the answer is yes, he'll face a bigger fight than he anticipated.
        People will fight much harder against a president who does bad things than a candidate who says bad things.

        Actually,  @realDonaldTrump , while you're at it, delete your presidency.
        It's really too bad the trade unions got co-opted so hard in this country by the establishment political system. We could use IWW, CNT, FAI.
        .@realDonaldTrump THANKS FOR KEEPING ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUT. NOW THE LINES AT THE BAGGAGE CLAIM WILL BE MUCH SHORTER @webmink

        So.... Clinton's mailserver had STARTTLS encryption years ago, while http://whitehouse.gov  (whmo DOT mil) doesn't offer it today?
        That's on you @symantec, they seem to be using your Symantec Messaging Gateway.
        http://whitehouse.gov  is already secured using DNSSEC, so adding STARTTLS & then add DANE TLSA would boost your mail security a lot.
        And since email to the Whitehouse goes through .MIL, no doubt they would benefit from the additional security as well.
        But don't listen to me. Listen to your own government/administration. IPv6/DNSSEC deployment status: https://usgv6-deploymon.antd.nist.gov/

        It's certainly unfair to say everyone who loves Trump hates Muslims. But based on feedback I get, people who hate Muslims REALLY love Trump.

        Trump Is Planning To Speak In Milwaukee This Thursday

        For readers who don't know, State dissent memos are rarely signed by more than one person. So hundreds of signers would be highly unusual.
