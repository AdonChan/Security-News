        13. Municipal office matters because cities and towns are where we all live. State legislators can promote democracy and fight big money.
        14. It was New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski who got the key documents behind Chris Christie's bridge gate.
        15. It was the Massachusetts legislature who voted to take away collective bargaining rights for public employees.http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/04/27/out-of-left-field-massachusetts-house-votes-to-end-collective-bargaining-for-public-workers/#50a8ebd042b1 ...

        @matthewstoller former mayor of city I'm familiar with telegraphed loudly that he couldn't wait to get bumped upstairs, was weirdly "normal"
        17. This isn't against ambition. Ambition can be a good spur to accomplishment. But there's ambition to do things and ambition to be things.
        18. It's time to focus on breaking the power of concentrated finance and restoring democracy. That is what Trumpism should signify.
        19. And no, it's not a pure pro-localism angle either. It's an anti-concentration approach. Federal gov't matters!https://twitter.com/BrianNumeroDos/status/823388938941399040 ...

        Every single permission they say is bad about Meitu? They request it. They also explicitly request the phone's IMEI.
        Maybe someone at @kaspersky would like to explain why their app needs the "Record audio" permission before complaining about other apps
        And maybe someone at @kaspersky would like to reassure us about why sending our IMEIs to Russia is preferable to sending them to China
        A post on why @kaspersky are hypocrites and also on why Android app permissions are still too complicated: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/46403.html 
        The ring taught us that TV static is of the devil and you don't stick a video tape into a VCR just cuz you found it (same goes for USBs)
        The permissions you're worried about in Meitu? Snapchat asks for them too.
        Look there are perfectly legitimate reasons to be worried about apps that want these but the fact that they're Chinese isn't a good one
        And right now having a Russian company tell a US audience that a Chinese app is bad when they're guilty of the same?
        There's going to be a lot of pressure to blame China for infosec issues over the next few years. Let's not do so when it's not a real story.
