        Would they be rushing to repeal it if it were called "ReaganCare" or something? This seems more about denying Obama a legacy than policy.
        I know people who don't feel well served by the ACA. That's how policies work. Reason to tweak and adjust. not burn it down.

        Excited to read Economism by @jamesykwak http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536159/economism-by-james-kwak/9781101871195/ ... 
        @matthewstoller ha. I'm for tougher antitrust enforcement on tech companies as well.
        The best opposition to Trump is coming from @alfranken and @BernieSanders. Bernie is going after Trump's base by hitting the economic grift.
        Meanwhile, @alfranken was the only Dem OPPOSITION member to show up for the Jeff Sessions hearing.
        The preening self-righteousness of Democrats towards Sessions contrasted very poorly with their softball handling of Sessions in the Q&A.
        Sessions routinely said things like 'well that's not what my memory is' for on the record changes of position. Franken rattled him.
        Most just asked Sessions a tough question, and then did little follow-up after he evaded or answered it. They didn't want conflict.
        Irony that it was @alfranken, one of the only non-lawyers on the committee, who did a real cross-examination. Democrats, learn from Franken.
        Take a tutorial in how to do real cross-examination. It's a skill. Learn it. It's been eight years, but you're the opposition now.
        The other person to damage Trump was Indiana Steelworker President Chuck Jones, who showed up Trump as lying on the jobs he promised.
        Oh, and the whole 'voting down cheaper pharma drugs amendment' proves Trump right on how you're bought by big money. So don't do that.
        Good for Klobuchar and Bernie for putting up that pharma amendment and forcing a vote. More of that please. Good for Franken for showing up.
        I know it's tempting to say about everything these days, This is crazy.
