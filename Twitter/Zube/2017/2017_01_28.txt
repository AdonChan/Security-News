        Imagine 70 top experts in any other field denouncing reckless misreporting of a topic that put lives at risk.http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687 
        @Pinboard ah, I see, so, climate change
        Online security is not a tech topic, just like public health is not a medical topic. It affects everyone and should be reported that way
        @Pinboard this italian news site wrote about the issue and mentioned the open letter to The Guardianhttp://www.ilpost.it/2017/01/23/whatsapp-crittografia-guardian/ ... 
        @Pinboard calls it a "stumble" (inciampo) by The Guardian
        Reminder that our first Seattle meeting is TONIGHT, 7 PM near the Space Needle (of course!) Everyone is welcome; contact me for an invite
        BILLY MAYS HERE FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN THE TECH INDUSTRY
        Buying donuts in Seattle is like buying internet in NZ. Guilt-tripped for buying "too much" of something that is a commodity everywhere else
        I literally shut down the donut store two hours before closing with my order of four dozen. At least they gave me a bag, unlike Portland
        The Good Lord saith: "I will judge the procrastinators last". Still not too late to get an invite to the 7PM Seattle event. Email or signal
        @Pinboard not to mention that one of the top news papers in the world is without an ombudsman as the entire political landscape is shifting
        Exactly! Have to wonder what else is piling up on the Guardian ombudsman's desk as (s)he takes a leisurely holiday. Can't they hire a temp?
        @Pinboard otoh I got best retail experience of my life buying another commodity (which could lead to donut consumption) in Vancouver, WA... 
        Thanks to the 122 friendly, lovely people who attended the first Seattle tech solidarity event tonight!

        POTUS Philly visit radio crypto score: C-.
        Keep in mind that there's been considerable grade inflation here.
        I guess with the vacancies at the State Dept, the Trump Twitter account is now our chief instrument of diplomacy. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824616644370714627 ... 
        Sorry about my stupid mistake earlier. I've changed the password. It's now Aqenbpuu.
        And so a data breach at Twitter now has serious foreign policy and natsec consequences.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/824726775938813952 ... 
        A student in my tech policy class pointed out the Twitter verification process effectively authenticates the POTUS to millions of people.
        Autocorrect really wants POTUS to be POTATOES. I'm having a hard time arguing that that's wrong.
        There is no more convincing display of strength and independence than to capitulate fully and immediately to administration policy.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/824767281146245120 ... 
        No, nothing the least bit totalitarian, fascistic or un-American about a WH official telling the press it should "keep its mouth shut".https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/824714984773058560 ... 
        After @POTUS speech in Philly, I'll revise my tweet. This IS an effort to suppress legitimate voters & I WILL fight like hell against it.https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/824257690406940672 ... 
        Hard to believe it's been less than a week since the beforetime.
        There is NO TRUTH to the rumor that I've been ordered to distract you with things like tweeting my password as we slip policies through.
        We can try to pretend that our little field is immune, but when politics becomes hostile to science it affects all of our lives.
        We assure the American people that winning will never be enough for the President. He will not rest until all opposition is crushed.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824968416486387713 ...

        All the talk of 'fighting' when Dems don't have the votes shows a lack of vision, not will. Among voters and pols.https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/824972743691083776 ... 
        Let's not forget: plenty of Obama supporters chose not to see inconvenient facts + often accepted produced symbols over substantive change.https://twitter.com/maryantico/status/824968856028475392 ... 
        "Trump's immigration orders will make private prison companies filthy rich" https://news.vice.com/story/trump-immigration-orders-will-make-private-prisons-rich ...  via @vicenews
        The real opposition to people who believe in democracy is concentrated financial power. The GOP is just the mouthpiece of big money.
        Voters are confused and angry b/c they were lied to for eight years. They want a fight, not meaningless NO votes.https://twitter.com/mattkbh/status/824979406611419137 ... 
        Real leadership would mean a Democratic leader saying 'here's what went wrong' with the Clinton-Bush-Obama era.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/januaryfebruary-2017/democrats-must-become-the-party-of-freedom/ ... 
        And then a Democratic leadership picking an ACTUAL fight. Find a split among the GOP and exploit it. Not this blubbering chest-beating.
        Not necessarily. It could just be part of the same con run for years.https://twitter.com/mattkbh/status/824980313130545154 ... 
        How dare Trump stop the TPP? How dare he renegotiate NAFTA? How dare he impose tariffs so jobs don't go to Mexico? That would be the con.
        @matthewstoller ok, this is helpful. You're not saying voting no in a lost cause is pointless.
        If you guys are signing up for the Muslim registry, Salma and I need a new blender and toaster. Thanks.

        Companies that support "2FA" but don't have printable backup codes have auth bypass through customer service. Avoid.
        To disable SMS 2FA on Facebook, you'll need to delete your cell phone from the contact info in your profile.
        I'm sure this is a bug, and will be fixed. But for now, if you're antsy about SMS (I am, but I'm paranoid), that's how to fix.
