        Hospital programmers interface with the devices using the short range channel (initially), using a special wand. That works pretty well. 3/
        However there is also a class of home monitoring devices (Merlin @Home) that uses only RF. These devices are easy to get. 4/
        The summary of the problem is that critical commands: shocks, device firmware updates etc. should only come from hospital programmer 5/
        Unfortunately SJM didn't use strong authentication. Result: any device that knows the protocol (including home devices) can send these 6/
        And worse, they can send these (potentially dangerous) commands via RF from a distance. Leaving no trace. 7/
        When I say "these devices don't use strong authentication" I'm not joking. The core defense is 24-bit RSA. No, that's not a typo. 8/
        Let me be clear: these vulnerabilities are IN THE IMPLANTABLE DEVICES THEMSELVES. The only fix is to update their firmware. 10/
        So far as I can see from the FDA and SJM announcements, nobody has yet proposed a plan to update implantable device firmware! 11/
        I don't even know what that would entail. Maybe bringing patients into doctor's offices. A logistical frigging nightmare. 12/
        Ok. Now we get to the scary part. Which I stress is strictly hypothetical. 13/
        There are 1000s of Merlin at Home boxes in patients' homes. As I pointed out, IF COMPROMISED, these boxes can issue harmful commands 14/
        Compromising one box at a time is very time consuming and unlikely. But what if you could push harmful code to ALL OF THEM AT ONCE. 15/
        That scenario is nightmare fuel. It should be keeping SJM and the FDA up at night until they can rule it out. 16/16 (end)
        But in case 24-bit RSA isn't bad enough, the manufacturers also included a hard-coded 3-byte fixed override code. I'm crying now. 9/
