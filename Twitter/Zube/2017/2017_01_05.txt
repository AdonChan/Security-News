        Also note: The fact the compromise vector was not redacted from the Podesta dump shows that hacking and analysis were separated departments.
        If this was a small hacker collective, they would have sought & redacted their compromise vector from the dump. Wouldn't burn themselves.

        If you could have one new security control seamlessly implemented for your company what would it be? #1newdefense
        @_mwc Trick question: I'd rather have OLD controls. Like asset management, patching, and DNS hygiene. Is there a new thing that does those?

        As my Inkscape workshop is coming closer, I'll tag the post so feel free to mute them #inkange
        so, I'll give a workshop on Inkscape in Zurich on the 11th of February http://www.beerontuesday.ch/?p=243  #inkange
        if you have questions or suggestions, drop me an e-mail or come to the next Beer on Tuesday #inkange
        I'll give examples of what I'm considering teaching during the workshop in the next days #inkange
        please suggest even if you can't make it, as I'll prepare a slide deck before and it will be released publicly #inkange
        of course the goal of the workshop is that everyone attending has the opportunity to try and learn to do something specific. #inkange

        The history of the tech industry is antitrust breaking incumbents to allow in the next wave of innovation.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust-2013/estates-of-mind/ ... 
        Monopolists today are not smarter. The change is that the legal rules are like the 19th century, so the trusts have been reborn.
        The oil, chemical, aluminum, and steel industries were once high-tech. Innovation isn't new. Monopoly isn't new.
        Google exists because Microsoft wasn't allowed to kill it by an antitrust suit. Microsoft exists b/c of a suit against IBM. And so forth.
        The entire computer industry and software industry (not the tech, but the industry) is a function of antitrust enforcement.
        I'll leave you with this. The Sherman Act was passed by Republican Senator John Sherman, brother of Union general William Tecumseh Sherman.
        This is because great creative innovation is a function of political freedom. And fundamentally monopoly is an enemy of that.

        But as your organisation and its responsibility grows, you need specialists too: security, databases, front-end, ...
        Reality is, you don't need to be the best at css/php/sql/ops/... to get things done. But knowing a bit of everything is *hugely* valuable.

        Hvisor monitors if kernel illegally exec()s a more priv'ed processes... Trivially by-passable by shellcode which uses kernel internal API :/https://twitter.com/coreos/status/809536648556007429 ... 
        Contrary to a popular opinion, an attacker doesn't need to execve(/bin/bash) nor calc.exe, nor call any syscalls, once in the kernel.
        To detect such attacker, the hvisor would need to monitor all interesting functions in the kernel. Soon the hvisor would become v. complex..
        In fact it would quickly mirror the complexity of the kernel that it is supposed to monitor. We thus end up not far from where we started :/
        A slightly better approach is to offload monitor to unprivd VM. Sadly other problems, some inherent to x86, makes this similarly futile :/
