        Taking a job at Tesla now means getting in on the ground floor of a brand new industry, like working for IBM in 1933

        Are there hundreds of Tesla employees standing out in front of their buildings in solidarity, like at Google? No? 
        @Pinboard you need someone decent in there with a desire to make the country better, who can steer leaders right, like the Krupps family.

        How weird is it that Tesla would end up sunk by a collaborationist founder, rather than its various money troubles?

        WTF @ @Firefox's media.getusermedia.screensharing.allowed_domains defaults!
        It seems @firefox defaults to allowing a bunch of nasty insecure web-based conf sites like webex\.com to capture your screen contents.
        1. @firefox likely doesn't enforce https for the whitelisted domains, so on a compromised network an attacker can just provide a fake site.
        2. If (when) any of these companies go under, a malicious party can buy up the domain & attack users with outdated @firefox versions.

        In 2015 I had the opportunity to meet and interview some of our Nation's top special forces from the US Special Operations Command 1.
        I was disturbed by stories SOC recalled from the field; innocents walking into frame of US drone strikes in the last seconds of deployment 2
        One such story involved the lazing/painting of targets related to Anwar Al-Awlaki -3
        Contact said there were months of targeting, near misses, & strange stories of changing cars, etc, related to Al-Awlaki before he was hit -4
        I asked about Abdulrahman al-Awlaki & contact told me some bad actors in special forces would talk about the symbolism of his killing -5
        I often saw Abdulrahman's murder as a horrific footnote to another horrid extra-judicial killing -6
        but Saturday's killing of his daughter Nora, and possibly his widow in a 2:30am raid in Yemen made me revisit that symbolism quip  -7
        We literally have a president who said he wants to kill terrorists families. -8
        Even if that is NOT what happened here, and it is just a matter of time and place that Anwar's family died during US extra-judicial raids -9
        It will not be hard for terrorists to say that Trump is doing exactly what he said --killing terrorist's families as a posthumous penalty -10
        Whatever it's meaning; Trump had his first extrajudicial raid & killed an 8 year old American girl ~+58 others http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/seal-american-girl-die-first-trump-era-u-s-military-n714346 ...  -11
