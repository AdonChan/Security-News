        I have a revelation on hacking that I will share this week. I know things. Big things. I know the cyber like you wouldn't believe.
        I would have shared them yesterday, but the press didn't send anyone to my party to hear them.
        I know things about what Donald Trump knows about hacking that even @realDonaldTrump doesn't know.
        The real reason Donald Trump doesn't use a computer is he knows so much about hacking he could bring down the power grid just logging in.
