        Puzzled by snarking at a Burlington Electric, which appears to be guilty of nothing more than being vigilant in exactly the ways we suggest.
        But I guess one should never be puzzled by snarking these days, lest you spend a lot of time being puzzled.
        And now we'll all conclude that protecting utilities & critical infrastructure isn't important because this report turned out to be wrong.
        To be fair, it is really hard to find graphics for hacking stories sometimes. 
        The so-called "ski masks" you see on hackers in stock photos protect against dangerous flying particles of hacked bits. Commonsense safety.
        The unrealistic part is that they don't usually show the hacking goggles. Many kids have gotten hurt emulating these photos while hacking.
        Also, important to remember that with today's high bit densities, standard N95 respirator masks provide almost no protection while hacking.
        Anyway, just wanted to share some of the things I know about hacking that other people don't know.
