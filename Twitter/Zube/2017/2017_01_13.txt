        GReAT report on #EyePyramid: hackers were "amateurs". 
        Kaspersky only just released signatures for the malware used by #EyePyramid. None of the other AVs caught it either.
        Independently of the technicalities (tweetstorm later) the post mortem is: target of #EyePyramid? you were running AV? /totally/ useless.
        Note also that GReAT & the others were totally blind until the Polizia Postale went public. They had samples and missed it.

        Actually i have no idea who inserts *** spam *** in the subject of those appe id password reset emails. Is it iOS Apple mail doing this?
        i cannot look into full headers because i am currently locked into the most useless email software there is: iOS http://Mail.app

        Optimal Republican strategy: allow Trump to win, then force him to resign, leaving Pence in power.
        The interesting question is, how many Republican leaders have consciously had this strategy, and for how long?
        Come to think of it, no one can have had it for that long, because even the Trump campaign expected to lose till the day of the election.
