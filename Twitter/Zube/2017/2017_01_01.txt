        An IT Director, who literally switches between $100,000 Porches and BMW's every few years, once told me something that's always stuck.
        "On a mid-range sedan today you can get better amenities, reliability, and technology than a high-end BMW (think M3) I drove 6 years ago."

        There's a small chance you'd get a video of your great-grandmother seeing a flash, turning around, and watching the cloud of Hiroshima rise.

        It'd be useful to have a wikipedia-like database for collecting quotes and actions done by various govs/orgs/groups/actors.
        Each entry would link to "evidence" (e.g. an article in NYT or RT, or a new law document). Hope is to be able to decipher (hidden) agendas.
        Of course the service would need to be a fully decentralized, requiring proof-of-work, etc, bitcoin-style like. #MakeSenseOfThePolitics
        Even more ideally(?): each user could decide which contributors she wants to trust and see only the datapoints from their reports.
