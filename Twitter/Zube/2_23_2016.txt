        #FBI Director Comey comments on San Bernardino matter: https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-director-comments-on-san-bernardino-matter ... 
        I'm puzzled by the argument that Apple's capability to crack phones proves that key escrow can be done securely. It shows the opposite.
        And, in fact, Apple has been moving to architectures in which it doesn't retain such capability, precisely because it improves security.
        It's actually possible to be both against terrorism and in favor of robust computer security. In fact, the latter helps with the former.
        I'm less concerned w/ whether Apple should be compelled to comply with this order than with ensuring future products can be more secure.
        It turns Apple in to a centralized target. It is a poor security design that Apple has been smartly moving away from.
        My biggest concerns with the San Bernardino order are with the degree of burden and risk, which seem way out of proportion to the benefit.
        I would have thought that one of the things they teach in terrorism school is to not use your employer-issued phone to plan your attacks.

        Thing that's worth noting - Ubuntu don't ship nvidia.ko, because they were threatened with legal action in the mid-2000s
        Comparing zfs.ko to nvidia.ko was a dreadful political move, because Canonical had effectively previously admitted that that was infringing
        But deleting the comparison doesn't change the facts - shipping zfs.ko is as infringing as nvidia.ko is
