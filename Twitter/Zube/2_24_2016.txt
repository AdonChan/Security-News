        How to get bought stuff from Mac store from one notebook to a travel notebook without exposing the Apple ID to travel notebook?
        I think it is hilarious that if you pay not the exact amount of a fine even if you overpay it is considered NOT PAID. At least in #austria
        Test case failed ... Reason: software outputs errror instead of error ...
        Hint: The if you enter the wrong passcode too often, it doesn't wipe the UID key (it can't do that), but the flash. (1/2)
        If you can replace the flash, that doesn't matter anymore (2/2). [Only applies to iDevices without Secure Enclave, obviously]

        . @publictorsten this is a probability number game. Few apps have very low probability of collision but many apps have high collision count.

        Last year, the talking point was "Apple is terrible for making a phone they can't unlock."
        The Apple/San Bernardino issue is partly a consequence of poor law enforcement tech capability; this could be improved without backdoors.
        It's not that new tech doesn't pose challenges to FBI, it's that their proposed solutions are dangerous & ignore alternative approaches.
        The debate & reporting on the Apple/San Bernardino case swings wildly between impressive technical precision and frightening misinformation.
        And both sides exhibit both extremes.
        Another problem is that the legal, policy, and technology arguments are largely different here, but easy to conflate with one another.
        My first reaction to this whole Apple thing was "wow, this is incredibly complicated." I underestimated.
        More similarities than differences between a court order instructing you to compromise security in a particular way and a bug report.
        I perversely like the idea of a world where the FBI helps debug smartphone security by obtaining All Writs warrants to exploit weaknesses.
        Now we're going to have people demanding the dancing 106 year old's birth certificate. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/02/22/dancing-106-year-old-describes-the-day-she-charmed-the-obamas-i-can-die-smiling-now/ ... 
        I usually get annoyed when a DVD forces me to watch an FBI warning, but in the case of the @1971Film, it seems totally appropriate.
        My biggest fear about FBI compelling vendors to sign updates: people being reluctant to update their software. Security ecosystem disaster.
        Vendors being able to roll out security patches through signed updates that consumers are confident in is critical. Delicate ecosystem.
        I worry in particular that an adversarial court process isn't well equipped to consider these kinds of negative externalities.
        If you're not already following iPhone forensics expert @JZdziarski for eye-opening analysis on the FBI vs. Apple case, you really should.

        update: I found the root cause behind this bug https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/701802353524015104 ... 

        the broken code had a call stack like this: run â†’ _artiq_raise â†’ _Unwind_RaiseException â†’ unwind_phase2.
        that actually unwinds the stack i.e. restores the old register state and jumps to exception handler.
        PIC mode; it put the GOT in callee-saved r18 and expected it to be preserved across the unwind edge. _U_RaiseExn clobbered r18.
        unwind_phase2 skipped the frame corresponding to _U_RaiseExn for a reason unknown to me. adding do_nothing(NULL,NULL) to __artiq_raise...
        caused it to also clobber r18, and subsequently caused r18 to be restored by unw_phase2, which masked the root cause.
        the most fun part was that I don't have an on-chip debugger in this SoC and also adding debugging prints changes register allocation,
        yet again masking the bug. so the only tool I had was assembly listings and contemplation
