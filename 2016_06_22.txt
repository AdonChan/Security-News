        These two talks seem really similar to me: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Demay ...  https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Vidal ...  Battle of the CAN bus tools!
        It's amazing what me and @nudehaberdasher accomplished without all these fancy new tools, just ecomcat and vehicle spy.
        I am curious what they meant about bypassing security access without knowing the algorithm.  Will be super awesome or super disappointing.

Myriachan

        @Myriachan why can't the proposals be "do the sensible, expected thing that real programs are already accidentally depending on".
        @Myriachan it's exasperating, is there nobody on the C++ committee pushing back on this stuff, or is it all a bunch of compiler writers?
        @Myriachan it should be sending a strong message that (especially around aliasing and stuff) developers are seriously at odds with the spec.
        @DrPizza @Myriachan The C++ standards committee are grossly negligent in their roles; and the compiler writers only care about themselves.

        I have a new theory why Tech Titans love open-plan offices with excessive developer density. By keeping humans way too densely packed, ...
        .. you breed both supergerms and humans resistant against them. This means if the regulator ever decides to do something, you can send ..
        .. your developers into battle, and, Cortez-style, they will win even though they are outnumbered 100000:1. Cunning, and devious.

        At the very least can liberals stop using the word "taxpayer" when they mean citizens & stop using "taxpayers" when they mean public funds.

        It's one of those times where I'm glad I have a stash of devices running old versions of Android
        This plug runs NodeMCU, "An open-source firmware and development kit that helps you to prototype... within a few Lua script lines"
        Everything continues to make no sense
        Finally managed to get this plug connected to the network by REing the broken app to discover the config packet format
        The app still doesn't believe in it though, which makes this a little less convenient
        Cool this "encryption" appears to be XORing against a pseudo-random sequence from lrand48()
        In other news ha ha oh god IoT
        Yeah I can decode the packets from the control server in China lolsigh
        I've got this far without actually being able to get the shipped app to talk to the fucking thing
        Oh hey look at that the app actually works fine on old versions of Android this is my shocked face

        Pretty sure the real Wayne Rooney is lying at the bottom of a quarry and has been replaced by his FIFA video game counterpart.
        En-gerland, En-gerland,
        "In moy aand are all the tools I need to faackin sit on a bleedin sofa you slaaag."
        Today: Boris Johnson is expected to offer a 10% off voucher for entry to Alton Towers to everyone who votes #Leave.
        America's attitude to guns is plainly ridiculous. Bombs are a much more efficient way of killing large numbers of people.
        So I say to America, legalise bombs, but don't legalise bombings, the same way guns are legal but you can't shoot anyone with them.
        On a bus earlier I was approached by a man in an iron mask. "Monsieur," he said. "Vote #Remain innit bruv. AdiÃ³s, like." Powerful stuff.
        What's that lollipop lady doing on a fucking motorway anyway?

        FOUND: a ring on the pavement outside my house this morning. If you've lost a ring, tough, it's mine now.
        On the bus earlier I was approached by a piglet on a hoverboard. "I don't give a fig about your referendum," it oinked. "I am just a child."
        "Brits don't quit." Fucking fuck off you fucking insincere fucking fuckfaced fucktruncheon and go and fuck yourself up the fucking fuckduct.
        BRITS DON'T QUIT. YES THEY DO, DAVE. THEY FUCKING DO IT ALL THE FUCKING TIME YOU FUCKING SEPTIC HORSE NOZZLE.
