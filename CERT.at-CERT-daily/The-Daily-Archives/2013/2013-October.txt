*** Cisco NX-OS RIP denial of service ***
---------------------------------------------
Cisco NX-OS is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) service engine. By sending a specially-crafted RIPv4 or RIPv6 message to UDP port 520, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the RIP service engine to restart.

However, instead of a phishing site the links they contained led to an advert for ?male medication?.

Recently, two papers independently outlined new attacks against DNS, undermining some of the security features protecting us from DNS spoofing.  As Dan Kaminsky showed [1], 16 bit query IDs are an insufficient protection against DNS spoofing. As a result, DNS servers started to randomize the source port of DNS queries in order to make DNS spoofing harder. This was never meant to "fix" DNS spoofing, but worked well enough for DNSSEC to be pushed back yet again.  Overall, to
