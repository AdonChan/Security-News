The new infected documents share similarities with previously detected exploits but carry a different payload. This time these exploits are being used to deliver Taidoor and PlugX backdoors, according to FireEye.

*** The Security Impact of HTTP Caching Headers, (Fri, Nov 15th) ***
---------------------------------------------
Earlier this week, an update for Media-Wiki fixed a bug in how it used caching headers. The headers allowed authenticated content to be cached, which may lead to sessions being shared between users using the same proxy server. I think this is a good reason to talk a bit about caching in web applications and why it is important for security.

Renesys is reporting two separate incidents where they observed traffic for 1500 IP blocks being diverted for extended periods of time. They observed the traffic redirection for more than 2 months over the last year. Does it seem unusual for internet traffic between Ashburn Virginia (63.218.44.78) and Washington DC (63.234.113.110) to go through Russia to Belarus? That is exactly what they observed. Once traffic flows through your routers there are countless opportunities to capture and modify...

*** Security Headers on the Top 1,000,000 Websites: November 2013 Report ***
---------------------------------------------
It has been almost exactly a year since we conducted the first top 1 million security headers report so it is a great time to re-run the analysis and see how well security header adoption is growing.

*** Rogue that takes webcam pictures of you ***
---------------------------------------------
Recently we heard of a rogue fake antivirus that takes screenshots and webcam images in an attempt to further scare you into succumbing to it's scam. We gathered a sample and sure enough, given some time it will indeed use the webcam and take a picture of what's in front of the camera at that time. This variant is called "Antivirus Security Pro" and it's as nasty as you can get.

*** Fake 'October?s Billing Address Code' (BAC) form themed spam campaign leads to malware ***

Have you received a casual-sounding email enticing you into signing a Billing Address Code (BAC) form for October, in order for the Payroll Manager to proceed with the transaction?

*** ATM Traffic + TCPDump + Video = Good or Evil?, (Wed, Nov 27th) ***
---------------------------------------------
I was working with a client recently, working through the move of a Credit Union branch. In passing, he mentioned that they were looking at a new security camera setup, and the vendor had mentioned that it would need a SPAN or MIRROR port on the switch set up. At that point my antennae came online - SPAN or MIRROR ports set up a session where all packets from one switch ports are "mirrored" to another switch port.
