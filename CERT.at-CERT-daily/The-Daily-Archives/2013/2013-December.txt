Ever since we exposed and profiled the evasive, multi-hop, mass iframe campaign that affected thousands of Web sites in November, we continued to monitor it, believing that the cybercriminal(s) behind it, would continue operating it, basically switching to new infrastructure once the one exposed in the post got logically blacklisted, thereby undermining the impact of the campaign internationally.

*** Putting malware in the picture ***
---------------------------------------------
Spammers actively spread malware using fake notifications on behalf of various financial and banking institutions, booking and delivery services and other companies. The arsenal of tricks used by cybercriminals is constantly being updated. In particular, in recent years we have registered a number of English- and German-language mass mailings in which the attackers try to hide malware under photos and pictures.

---------------------------------------------
Microsoft is aware of an improperly issued subordinate CA certificate that could be used in attempts to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. The subordinate CA certificate was improperly issued by the Directorate General of the Treasury (DG Tr?sor), subordinate to the Government of France CA (ANSSI), which is a CA present in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities Store. This issue affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is not currently aware of attacks related to this issue.

*** Hacked Via RDP: Really Dumb Passwords ***
---------------------------------------------
Businesses spend billions of dollars annually on software and hardware to block external cyberattacks, but a shocking number of these same organizations shoot themselves in the foot by poking gaping holes in their digital defenses and then advertising those vulnerabilities to attackers. Todays post examines an underground service which rents access to hacked PCs at organizations that make this all-too-common mistake.

Sadly, however, Kaspersky has found that the document Safari creates to allow such restoration is in plaintext and contains user IDs and passwords. The file is hidden, but isnt hard to find once you know what you are looking for.

*** Blog: Malware in metadata ***

One of the systems I have been running collects all our web malware detections for .ES domains. I usually check it out every morning, just in case I see something especially interesting or relevant. And when I find something, I like to create some statistics to have a global overview.There are some things that I find every time I check my stats, like URLs that have been infected for more than 200 days, even being notified. That speaks of the lack of security awareness on some companies, and how

This is neat: Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPGs current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be...

Our November results showed progress against Sefnit and the installers and downloaders of Sefnit (Win32/Rotbrow and Win32/Brantall). In comparison to September, active Sefnit infections have been reduced by 82 percent. As with prior months, our rate of incorrect detections also remained low and performance stayed consistent.

Like most mainstream operating systems these days, fully patched installations of Linux provide a level of security that requires a fair amount of malicious hacking to overcome. Those assurances can be completely undone by a single unpatched application, as Andre' DiMino has demonstrated when he documented an Ubuntu machine in his lab being converted into a Bitcoin-mining, denial-of-service-spewing, vulnerability-exploiting hostage under the control of attackers.

*** 12 Days of HaXmas: Meterpreter, Reloaded ***
---------------------------------------------
Over the last quarter of 2013, we here in the Democratic Freehold of Metasploit found that we needed to modernize our flagship remote access toolkit (RAT), Meterpreter. That started with cleaving Meterpreter out of the main Metasploit repository and setting it up with its own repository, and then bringing in a dedicated Meterpreter hacker, the indomitable OJ TheColonial Reeves. We couldn't be happier with the results so far.

*** The story of a Trojan Dropper I ***
---------------------------------------------
Introduction: Recently, Zscaler ThreatlabZ received a suspicious file from one of our customers, which was named "OrderDetails.zip". After extracting the executable file from the archive I have performed a virustotal scan to get some information about the file.

*** The story of a Trojan dropper II ***
---------------------------------------------
Analysis: Lets analyze the PE file in detail and see what it's up to. Like most malware, this sample was packed and in order to properly analyze it, we must begin by unpacking the binary. Keeping this in mind, I began by debugging the file, hoping to find the reference to the data section in order to determine precisely where the encrypted portion of data was to be found. Fortunately,...
